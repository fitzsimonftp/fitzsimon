<h2 id="dt20110731">Sunday 31 July</h2>
<h3>Brisbane -&gt; Melbourne -&gt; Singapore -&gt; London</h3>
<p>Another adventure begins...</p>

<p>Big excitement! Andy and Brenda arrived home from four years living in Singapore, Hong Kong, Guangzhou and finally, Prague at 3am yesterday.&nbsp; They slept until 3pm, and then we celebrated with Pete and Rob an Aussie dinner at home of Prawn Cocktail, Steak and Salad, and homemade ice cream and fruit.&nbsp; Very non Czech.&nbsp; Andy played the didgeridoo and so settled back into Aussie culture.</p>

<p>They look great and we all skyped Nanna and enjoyed breakfast with them before leaving Brisbane on a beautiful July morning (31st).&nbsp; Arrived in Melbourne on a beautiful July morning also, and are now in the Qantas lounge, thanks to a couple of complimentary passes, waiting to board our flight to Singapore then London. (Yes the A380)</p>

<p>In London, we are meeting the Murphy clan.&nbsp; Carol (my friend from Med School; we met at the beginning of 1974, and we haven�t changed a bit! ), her husband Mike, and their son, Ben, who is working in London.&nbsp;  Hence, we have two Mikes, so I will from now on refer to Michael Xavier Murphy as simply, "Murphy".&nbsp;  As you know, I am known as "Fitzie", so Mike Murphy will have to have a turn with his surname.</p>

<p>Only 24 hours till we land in London.&nbsp; Then we have a big day driving to York, then staying in rural County Durham.</p>

<p>Cheers, Maureen.</p>

<h3>London to County Durham</h3>

<p>So lucky! Carol and Mike�s Brunei flight was only 3 hours late.&nbsp; Imagine if it had been delayed a day.&nbsp; We waited quite peacefully in the Budget car rental car park.&nbsp; Got to read the car manual.</p>

<small>Durham Cathedral</small>
</div>

<p>So, today, we went to Durham.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the Castle, now a University, was closed due to renovations.&nbsp; The outside looked great.&nbsp; We had a huge lunch at the old hospital (now caf�), and went on a superb guided tour of the Cathedral.&nbsp; Fascinating.&nbsp; Let�s face it� we have now seen 100s of European Cathedrals.&nbsp;  Our guide, Margaret, was amazing with her commentary and so made it all a great experience.</p>

<p>The town itself is so cutesy, and we loved it.</p>

<p>Finally solved my iPad nightmare.&nbsp; When at Heathrow, there was no phone shop at Terminal 3.&nbsp; Bought a SIM card from a vending machine for my iPad; price 20 pounds.&nbsp; Firstly, the machine accepted a 10 pound note.&nbsp; Then it would not accept any more notes.&nbsp; So, put in credit card.&nbsp; This was charged 20 pounds.&nbsp; Unfortunately didn�t get the 10 pound note back.&nbsp; Sim card was the wrong size.&nbsp; Went to internet shop in York.&nbsp; They sold me another card for 3 pounds, as the one I cut down did not work.&nbsp; Later, the system would not accept an Australian credit card without a direct link to a UK address.&nbsp; Went to a shop in Durham.&nbsp; They charged me 21 pound, installed and activated the sim and I finally could connect the iPad to the internet.&nbsp; So all this was 54 pounds for 3 gig of connectivity.&nbsp; Yuk!</p>

<p>Met up with Jacy Pitman and her son Rick for dinner at the Burtree Inn.&nbsp; Fantastic evening.&nbsp; Jacy's eldest son, Mark married Kate McNaughton, one of our good friends.&nbsp; Will meet up with Jacy�s daughter, Lucy, at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in a few days.</p>

<p>The countryside around here is just to die for.&nbsp; What a shame we do not have longer.</p>

<p>Love to all, <br />
Maureen

<h2 id="dt20110803">Wednesday 3 August</h2>
<h3>Lakes District</h3>

<p>Big Day.&nbsp; 12 plus hours of driving through exquisite scenery.&nbsp; Perfect weather.</p>

<p>Firstly, about the visit to the doctor.&nbsp; Very busy as I was leaving Australia, I left my thyroid tablets in the fridge at home.&nbsp; Just like annoying patients do to me all the time.&nbsp; Bugger!&nbsp; What a business!&nbsp; I had to ring the local doctor (spoke to his brother), make an appointment, go in and register with the NHS (even though I would be a private patient), and have a consultation.</p>

<p>I can tell you, the life of a country GP in England is very, very slow paced compared to Shailer Park Medical Centre.&nbsp; Anyway, Dr Neville was very nice, and did not charge me for the consultation, and it all amounted to 5 pounds for the medication.&nbsp; I left the surgery with him feeling really worried that he should also keep thyroid tablets in the fridge.</p>

<p>With such nice weather today, we headed to Barnard Castle (a town and a castle).&nbsp;  Just so fantastic.&nbsp; Walked around, went to the supermarket and it was all enchanting.&nbsp; Even the supermarket.</p>

<p>Then headed off to the Lake District.&nbsp; Very busy; school holidays the whole time we are here.&nbsp;  Everywhere we go, we have a yarn to the locals.&nbsp; I particularly like this aspect of touring.&nbsp; It is something that bus trips never deliver.&nbsp; We had coffee in Kendal.&nbsp; Lovely pub.&nbsp; Then went on to Windemere, Ambleside, Grasmere, Rydal (sheepdog championships are on there next week), and then Keswick.&nbsp; This is all Wordsworth/Keats country.&nbsp; Also Beatrix Potter.&nbsp; Tried to visit the Beatrix Potter house, but could not find a parking spot; school holidays :(&nbsp;  Went to the Castlerigg Stone Circle (a Druid site), and the views were just magnificent.&nbsp; Had a picnic lunch there before going on to Ullswater Lake.&nbsp; Simply wonderful.</p>

<p>Here we had a good natter to a bloke called Tom Carlisle, who had a camper called the <em>Tupperware Tardis</em>.&nbsp; It was very small, but had lots on the inside, with a lid.&nbsp; He was a local, and advised us on sights on Hadrian�s Wall.</p>

<p>Tom even gave us the URL for a digital story he had made for Tyne/Wear museums.&nbsp; It was all about his favourite road, the Military Road alongside Hadrian's Wall.&nbsp; Here is Tom's story... <a href="http://www.cultureshock.org.uk/stories/my-favourite-road.html" title="cultureshock.org.uk">http://www.cultureshock.org.uk/stories/my-favourite-road.html</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>As you all know, Hadrian�s Wall was built in 120 AD by the Romans.&nbsp; It was 117 km long.&nbsp;  Abandoned in 383, and it is simply amazing that so much remains today.&nbsp; There were forts every 5 mile along its length, and we saw many sights including <a href="http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/cawfields-roman-wall-hadrians-wall/">Cawfields</a>, <a href="http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/housesteads-roman-fort-hadrians-wall/">Housesteads</a>, Steel Rig, and <a href="http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/birdoswald-roman-fort-hadrians-wall/">Birdoswald</a>.&nbsp; The scenery was to die for, and we didn�t return to our lovely house until 8.30 pm.&nbsp; That twilight is so deceptive.&nbsp; It is dark at 10pm.</p>
</div>

<p>Tomorrow?&nbsp; Maybe Newcastle-upon-Tyne.</p>

<p>Hope everyone is happy and well,<br />

<small>Vintage Champagne from Reims for Carol's Birthday</small>
</div>
<p>Celebrated Carol�s birthday tonight with vintage French champagne from Reims.&nbsp;  This was a gift to me from Qantas for treating a passenger on the plane on the way over.&nbsp; Why always does this always happen to me?&nbsp; This was the first time Qantas has ever given me anything but a "thank you" for assisting.&nbsp; It was just beautiful.&nbsp; We sat in the slightly chilly garden, looking over the glowing fields and had fruit, cheese, crackers and champagne for dinner.&nbsp; It doesn�t get any better than this.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, off to Edinburgh, with lots to see on the way.<br />
Love, Maureen (and Mike, Mike, Carol and Ben).</p>

</div>
<p>It is now midnight and we are back from the opening night of <a href="http://www.edintattoo.co.uk/">The Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo</a>.&nbsp; Very enjoyable.&nbsp; Smaller than you would expect (having seen it on TV a number of times).&nbsp; 8825 people in attendance.&nbsp; Not too cold a night.&nbsp; The Aussies were there in beanies, scarves, gloves, overcoats, and plastic garbage bags over our jeans.&nbsp; The Scots were there in sundresses and thongs.&nbsp; As you would expect.&nbsp; Big walk back from the Tattoo (1 hr) warmed us up.</p>

<small>Lindisfarne Castle in the distance; built by Henry VIII with stone stolen from Lindisfarne Priory (foreground)</small>
</div>
<p>Earlier in the day, we went to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindisfarne">Lindisfarne Priory</a> and also had a big walk out to the castle.&nbsp; Perfect day, with blue skies and T shirts in the middle of the day.&nbsp;  This showed off the lilly-white arms and legs of the locals.&nbsp; Have you ever seen such white people?&nbsp; In the North of England, everyone seems to look the same as well.&nbsp; No real diversity like London.</p>

<p>Anyway, Lindisfarne was lovely, with a castle across a tidal causeway, and our timing was perfect to drive across on the low tide.&nbsp; Similar to Mont St Michel in France.&nbsp;  Very cute little St Mary's church there too, and stark ruins of the priory.</p>

<p>There is a Cuthbert Cult in Northern England.&nbsp; This poor beggar who was a shepherd, did some nice things, and was promoted to being Saint Cuthbert.&nbsp; There are statues everywhere, and Cuthbert groupies in all the churches.</p>

<p>Must mention the flowers.&nbsp; Wow!&nbsp; Everyone here � yes, everyone � has thrown a packet of mixed seeds in a pot or hanging basket, waved Harry Potter�s magic wand, and hey Presto!&nbsp; Magnificent flowers; just glorious.</p>

<p>Speaking of Harry Potter, we went to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alnwick_Castle">Alnwick Castle</a>; Harry Potter country.&nbsp; What a crowd!&nbsp; That was just the traffic.&nbsp; It was 22 pounds to see the Castle and grounds, so we had a coffee, a loo stop and peeked in at the garden.&nbsp; Aren't we scrooges?&nbsp; Drove around the outside of the castle, and took a great shot of it from a hill near town.&nbsp; Prior to this we had been to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warkworth_Castle">Warkworth Castle</a>, and also did the cheap option of just taking outside photos.&nbsp; Have been in enough old homes and castles, and don�t need to see another inside view.&nbsp;  Blue skies made it all so beautiful.</p>

<p>We visited a little fishing village called St Abb�s Head.&nbsp; All around was spectacular coastal scenery, lots of sea birds, and an unspoiled working harbour.&nbsp; Friendly locals too.&nbsp; Nearby, more breathtaking coastal scenery at Pease Bay.&nbsp; Thinking of our mutual friend Mary Pease � firstly visiting the lovely St Mary's Church, and then Pease Bay.&nbsp; It was a real Mary Pease Day!</p>

<p>Now we are in our new place in Comely Bank, Edinburgh (45 Orchard Brae Gardens).&nbsp;  Better than expected.&nbsp; The cupboards are packed with condiments, and the kitchen has every utensil and appliance known to Myers; except for a frypan.&nbsp;  However, we have gone from 3 bathrooms to one bathroom.&nbsp; Not exactly slumming it.</p>

<p>Cheers,<br />

<p>So busy.&nbsp; Thanks to the GPS, saw lots of Glasgow, including some places we actually intended to visit.&nbsp; Don�t like to be rude, but&hellip; we now know why they migrate to Australia.&nbsp; The fact that it was cloudy and spitting probably did not help.&nbsp; However, the people were friendly, and we enjoyed the Cathedral, the University, the Kelvingrove art gallery (outside), and saw numerous weddings.</p>

<small>Another Glasgow Wedding; NOT the one at the cathedral where fake tan was troweled on the bridal party.</small>
</div>
</div>

<div class="article">
<p>We were freezing.&nbsp; In layers of coats and jumpers.&nbsp; The people at the weddings were in precipitous high heels and summer frocks.&nbsp; I have never seen such a blackened Cathedral (from soot).&nbsp; But, it was very nice.&nbsp; The bride had fake tan trowelled on by the bucket, and the organ music and vibe were fantastic.&nbsp; The view from the top of the necropolis was good, and overall we enjoyed ourselves.</p>

<small>The Falkirk Wheel</small>
</div>
<p>On the way back to Edinburgh, we went to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falkirk_Wheel">Falkirk Wheel</a>.&nbsp; This is a huge boatlift that revolves.&nbsp; The locks between the Union and Forth &amp; Clyde Canals were blocked by roads in the 1960s.&nbsp; Now this masterpiece of engineering uses the weight of water collected from the upper canal to lift boats up from the lower canal; only uses &pound;10 worth of electricity per day.&nbsp; The canals now connect between Glasgow and Edinburgh.&nbsp; Fascinating.</p>

<p>Have to mention that we are eating better than Kings.&nbsp; Mike Murphy and I did the shopping at Sainsburys in Orchard Brae (our suburb).&nbsp; What a selection!&nbsp; How cheap is the food!&nbsp; And what quality!&nbsp; For instance � raspberry punnets twice the size of ours for around $2 AU.&nbsp; In fact all fruit and veg are great value.&nbsp; A fraction of the price in Oz.</p>

<small>Fiz, Fiona &amp; Mike (Ostomyland meetup)</small>
</div>
<p>In the evening, Mike invited two of his internet ostomy mates over to dinner, Fiona and Fiz (Phyllis).&nbsp; Such lovely ladies.&nbsp; Even though they both live in Edinburgh, they only knew each other from the internet, so coming for dinner was a first in the flesh for them, as well as Mike.&nbsp; Carol and I rustled up a warm Thai beef salad and fruit platter, and we had a lovely evening with them, Talk about stoics!&nbsp; Imagine going back to work in a child care centre, debilitated, with in situ feeding tubes, etc.&nbsp; They had horror stories of their health, which they dealt with courageously.&nbsp; Carol and I really enjoyed their company, such that Carol wants to invite more of Mike�s internet pals to dinner!</p>

</div>
<p>Went to St Andrews famous golf course.&nbsp; Unfortunately, a showery day.&nbsp; Nevertheless, we trotted over a few holes, until it really started to rain.&nbsp; On Sundays, the public can <a href="http://www.standrews.org.uk/About-Us/Guided-Walks-on-the-Old-Course.html">walk the course</a>, free of charge.&nbsp; Went to the shop and could not believe 70 pounds for a T shirt!&nbsp; No way!</p>

<p>Dripping wet, we arrived at the Club house and had beautiful coffees and hot chocolate for less than 2 pounds 50 cents.&nbsp; Such an iconic venue.</p>

<p>Then walked around the town, and absorbed the history at the St Andrew�s Cathedral (pillaged for stone over the last 6 centuries).&nbsp; With historic graveyard.&nbsp; Surf was up on the beach, and we retreated to a caf�.&nbsp; Just beautiful food � 2 courses for 5 pounds ninety.&nbsp; Just loving the high Aussie dollar.</p>

</div>
<p>Then went to Dundee. Visited a floating 200 year old ship � the Unicorn. Imagine � built in 1824, and still afloat.&nbsp;  It is still fitted out as it was on its last voyage.&nbsp; Very interesting.&nbsp; We crawled through all decks, and the man taking our admission was full of interesting details about the ship.</p>

<p>On to Glamis Castle, so like the chateaus in the Loire in France.&nbsp; This was a royal hunting lodge in the 11th century.&nbsp; It was the childhood home of the Queen mother.&nbsp;  Such wonderful, extensive grounds.</p>

<p>On to Perth.&nbsp;  Yes, these Poms keep pinching the names of OUR places!&nbsp; Once the capital of medieval Scotland, we were interested in the Church of St John, founded in 1126.&nbsp; Here, John Knox delivered his fiery sermons.</p>

<p>Tonight, we dined on baked salmon.&nbsp; So cheap.&nbsp; We are really fortunate to be able to cook most of our meals, do washing etc., as we are in rented houses which are very convenient.</p>

<p>Thrilled that our friend, Mary Pease, tells us that her Grandfather was called &hellip; "Cuthbert".&nbsp; Can you believe it?&nbsp;  We actually know someone linked to the famous Cuthbert.&nbsp; (He is such a hottie here!&nbsp; Ask in any Cathedral).</p>

<p>Love to all<br />

<h3>Edinburgh</h3>
<p>Day in Edinburgh today, Mary MacKillop�s feast day too.&nbsp; So much to see and do.&nbsp; Could spend a month here and be frantic.&nbsp; Of course, it is cold.&nbsp; However, today, it was fine, with a sunny afternoon.&nbsp; We spent hours touring the castle.&nbsp; What a spectacular sight!&nbsp; It towers above Edinburgh on a big volcanic plug.&nbsp; We did a free tour of the castle and loved it all. Typically Scottish � there was a gun salute at 1 o�clock.&nbsp; Only one o�clock � so that they only had to fund <strong>one</strong> shot of gun powder.</p>

<p>We saw the Scottish crown, the stone of Scone, the Main Hall with its amazing ceiling, the Governor�s house, Margaret�s church, the War Memorial, the Dungeons, the Castle and all the rest.&nbsp; Mary, Queen of Scots, must have been pretty bored as a prisoner doing embroidery for 20 years, before being beheaded.</p>

<p>We headed down the Royal Mile.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.edfringe.com/">Fringe Festival</a> is full steam, so we barely noticed the historic buildings.&nbsp; Street theatre of dozens of genres was abundant.&nbsp;  Carol and I did pop in to St Giles Cathedral, with its beautiful stained glass and chapels, to light a candle for another Mary.&nbsp; It was so ornate, and the Mick Cathedral looked so Protestant.&nbsp; You figure.</p>

<p>After 6 hours of constant walking, we headed home, with our amazing Sainsbury�s on the way.&nbsp; We had pre-prepared a chicken curry, and then all but Carol headed out to meet up with Rebecca Pitman (Katie McNaughton�s sister in law), and friend Amy.&nbsp; We saw comedian Stephen Reid perform.&nbsp; Whacky, funny and different.&nbsp; This place is buzzing.&nbsp; But cold.</p>

<p>Love to all,<br />
Mike x 2, Carol , Ben and Maureen</p>

<h3>Edinburgh to Glencoe</h3>
<p>Via Inverness and Loch Ness</p>

<p>What a huge day!&nbsp; Rose early and headed to Stirling Castle.&nbsp; Decided it looked a lot like Edinburgh Castle so did not enter but enjoyed the magnificent views, on a sunny and cool day.</p>
</div>

<div class="article">
<div class="thumb">
<img src="http://www.fitzsimon.com.au/Maureen/images/2011UK/Doune_th.jpg" width="300" height="225" alt="Doune Castle" /><br />
<small>Doune Castle.<br /><em>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</em> was shot here.</small>
</div>
<p>Then on to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doune_Castle">Doune Castle</a>.&nbsp; What great value for money that visit was!&nbsp; This is the castle featured in <em>"Monty Python and the Holy Grail"</em>.&nbsp; Unlike Stirling and Edinburgh, it was not crawling with visitors, and was just fascinating.&nbsp; The audio tour incorporated some of the film scripts and we had great fun.&nbsp; It was the residence of Robert, Duke of Albany in the 14th Century.&nbsp; Lots of private stairs and narrow passages made it all very mysterious.</p>

<p>On to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitlochry">Pitlochry</a>.&nbsp; This is surrounded by pine forested hills, as we began to travel into the Highlands.&nbsp; There is a hydroelectric dam, and a "salmon ladder" beside it for the fish to swim upstream in early summer.&nbsp;  None today.&nbsp; There is a very large <a href="http://www.pitlochryfestivaltheatre.com/">Festival Theatre</a> in this little town of 2900 people.&nbsp; You should have seen the posters for upcoming productions � Sleeping Beauty, My Fair Lady, and lots of others.&nbsp; What a busy theatre group!&nbsp; The sun was shining and it was freezing in the shade.&nbsp; We had a picnic lunch and coffee beside the river.</p>

<p>On to the Cairngorm mountains.&nbsp; So beautiful.&nbsp; At one point we stopped to admire the view.&nbsp; A Chinese family had pulled up, and one of the ladies was singing beautifully, while another danced exquisitely.&nbsp; Just us and them.&nbsp; What a performance.&nbsp; They were really, really, good.</p>

<p>Admired Inverness, but stopped only briefly.&nbsp; Lovely view out towards the North Sea.</p>

<small>Where most Loch Ness Monster rumours are born?</small>
</div>
<p>Then down to Loch Ness, avoided the (tour coach-friendly) motorway, took the narrower road down the more picturesque southern side and it was just perfect.&nbsp;  Such a lovely setting.&nbsp; There was a bloke in a caravan, who had forsaken his girlfriend, job, and former life and now made little ceramic Nessies and sells them to tourists, to fund his research into the Monster.&nbsp; We imagine his research is mainly in the pub.&nbsp; The scenery was just divine and the afternoon perfect.</p>

<p>Drove down past other lakes along very, very, narrow roads, and through magnificent scenery to Fort William, where we picked up bread and milk and a few odds and sods.</p>

<p>Then on to find our little house/<a href="http://www.holiday-rentals.co.uk/Scotland/holiday-chalet-Scottish-Highlands--Islands/p1143.htm">Cottage in Glen Coe</a>, beside a pub (the <a href="http://www.clachaig.com/">Clachaig Inn</a>), way out in the sticks.&nbsp; A little difficult to find at first.</p>
</div>

<div class="article">
<p>Had a call from the owner of the previous house in Edinburgh who claimed we:
<ol>
	<li>Forgot to turn on the dishwasher (guilty, we think)</li>
	<li>Turned off the freezer causing a flood on the floor.&nbsp; Apparently the power to the freezer looks like every other switch above the kitchen bench, so when we turned off everything as we left, we must have done this one.&nbsp; (guilty)<br />
We were told this had never happened before.&nbsp; Amazing!&nbsp; Have never encountered a freezer switch which looks like lightswitch before.&nbsp;  They always have a plug.&nbsp; And we certainly have travelled.&nbsp; However, a puddle of water on the floor cannot be too terrible a problem.</li>
	<li>Vacummed up water with the new Dyson vacuum cleaner.&nbsp; (Absolutely not guilty).<br />
	Apparently it was a week old, so we think the cleaners were not familiar with it, decided to clean up the leaky freezer, and then decided to blame us.&nbsp; Very upset about being implicated in this one.</li>
</ol>

<p>Had a long discussion with the owner, who, understandably is protective of his new vacuum cleaner, and seems to believe the cleaners instead of us.&nbsp; He�s wrong there.</p>

<p>Went to the pub next door to our house for dinner.&nbsp; Very nice.&nbsp; So homely.&nbsp; This settlement has only our house and the pub.&nbsp; Isn�t that incredible?&nbsp; Nothing else for miles around, and Ben Nevis towers over us.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the weather looks to be turning rainy tomorrow.&nbsp; Will see.</p>

<p>Cheers to all,<br />
Maureen.</p>

</div>
<p>Rainy day!&nbsp; Made the most of it.&nbsp;  Went to Oban.&nbsp; Nice, but wet.&nbsp; Souvenir shopped, had coffee at a fish and chip shop which advertised "sit doon or take oot", admired the fake Colosseum.</p>

<p>Then drove around the region.&nbsp; Parts of it were simply stunning.&nbsp; Even in the rain.&nbsp; Only had to turn back for flooding once.&nbsp;  A mere 30 cm or so.&nbsp; Us Queenslanders do not call that a flood!&nbsp; Luckily, we had such a sunny day yesterday.&nbsp;   Boats everywhere.&nbsp; God knows when it is warm enough to go sailing!</p>

<p>The huge steep mountains have been covered in ribbons of waterfalls.&nbsp; It is like those pictures of Ayer�s Rock, except very, very green.&nbsp;  The creeks have been roaring along with chilly fast flowing clear water.</p>

<p>We were lucky to see it in the sunlight on the first day, and also seeing so many waterfalls is pretty special.&nbsp; Where we are staying is the best part of Scotland.&nbsp; Unbelievably beautiful.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, we might have a chilling out day, here is paradise.</p>

<p>Love to all.<br />

<h3>"The Jacobite" steam train, Fort William to Mallaig</h3>
<p>Started the day with a big sleep in, and woke to hear Carol announcing that she had cooked breakfast for us.&nbsp; Decadence!&nbsp; Mike Murphy had seen something about <em>"The Jacobite"</em>, a steam train from Fort William on the net.&nbsp; This has been voted Number 1 rail journey in the world for the last two years (by "Wanderlust" magazine) and strangely isn't even mentioned by Lonely Planet or the Eyewitness Colour book.</p>

<p>Fort William is 30 mins away.&nbsp; We arrived over an hour early and joined a queue, and managed to get a train cabin to ourselves.&nbsp;  We could photograph and see both sides of the train, so were very happy.</p>

<p>Today was cloudy, but no rain.&nbsp; Like a cold Brisbane winter day.&nbsp; This steam train journey was magnificent.&nbsp; The train toured to Mallaig � a small fishing port with a population of 770.&nbsp;  On the side of our carriage we saw the sign, "Hogwart's Express" and noted it had been used in the <em>"Harry Potter"</em> films, as had the Glenfinnan viaduct which we traversed.&nbsp; The journey went past Britain�s highest mountain (Ben Nevis), deepest Loch (Loch Morar), shortest  river (River Morar),  and most Westerly Station (Arisaig).&nbsp;  Just wonderful, so relaxing, and highly recommended.</p>

<p>Had a lovely return train journey and on to our bit of paradise in Glencoe.&nbsp; Looking forward to a big drive around the Isle of Skye tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Isle of Skye</h3>
<p>Day 12 of feeling Carol�s bum.&nbsp; Mike Murphy says I could do worse.&nbsp; Of course, this is the only course of action I have available to me when putting on my seat belt over and over!&nbsp; The Mike boys are in the "control panel" in the front seats, and do the entire driving � no mean feat.&nbsp; The girls and Ben are in the back � Carol in the middle.&nbsp; But&hellip; had another great day.&nbsp; Are we blessed or what!</p>

<p>Good job we�re sturdy.&nbsp; Today was 11.5 hours of travelling, and tomorrow is well over 400 miles of travelling.</p>

<p>Have to mention that all road signs in this part of Scotland are in Gaelic (and English).&nbsp; About 7 per cent of people here speak Gaelic.&nbsp; I told you we were in the sticks.</p>

<p>We drove up to the Isle of Skye today.&nbsp; Sensational!&nbsp; Scotland�s answer to Kangaroo Island and Fraser all in one.&nbsp; Nice morning with good weather.&nbsp; Saw the mist-topped Five Sisters and Eilean Donan Castle at Dornie on the way.&nbsp; As our friend, Noela L. would say, <em>"Picture-scew"</em>.&nbsp; Over the bridge at the Kyle of Lochalsh.&nbsp; Then on to the magnificent natural sights �</p>

<p>A 100 year-old cottage thatched with heather.&nbsp; Have to tell you that the heather is in full bloom everywhere.&nbsp; Just everywhere.&nbsp; So pretty and lavender.&nbsp; Also the other flowers � daisies and thistles, and lots of others we cannot name.&nbsp; Yellows, whites, and purple in the main.</p>

<p>Then past the capital of Skye, Portree.&nbsp; So cute and colourful.&nbsp;  Also crowded.&nbsp; Could not find a park, so went on to The Storr � an unusual rock formation.</p>

<p>Had coffee at <em>Columba 1400</em> in Staffin.&nbsp; This is a leadership centre taking young people who are disadvantaged and off the rails into their care.&nbsp; Like Boystown.&nbsp; They have great success statistics.</p>

<p>On to Kilt Rock, with vertical and horizontal patterns in the cliff face � have to admit it looked a bit like tartan.&nbsp; Wonderful coastline.</p>

<p>Over to  the Quiraing � a series of landslides has exposed the roots of this volcanic plateau, revealing  terrain featuring spikes and towers.&nbsp; Peat bog in between.&nbsp; Saw a motorhome attempt a stupid parking space and spin the wheels and bog.&nbsp;  Ran the other way.&nbsp; Yes&hellip; we are ashamed, but they were silly, and we had nothing to rescue them with.&nbsp;  We even adjusted our itinerary, to accommodate this new obstacle.</p>

<p>There was a food van there at the Quiraing with crocodile, kangaroo and zebra burgers. Mike Murphy reckoned they were not Zebras � just painted horses.&nbsp; The lady in the van looked offended.</p>

<p>Went on to beautiful coastal villages and a medieval cemetery (St Columba�s).</p>

<p>Then � Dunvegan Castle.&nbsp; Had a great time talking to the volunteer guides.&nbsp;  The MacLeod family have lived there for 800 years (except for about 50 years when they rented it out).&nbsp; I thought we were amazing to be in Shailer Park for over 30 years.&nbsp;  The gardens were huge and beautiful.&nbsp; Had a wonderful time then a few hours drive home.</p>

<p>Quick visit to the pub to use their wi-fi and upload this page.&nbsp; Huge drive to the Cotswolds tomorrow,<br />
