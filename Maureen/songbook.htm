<h2>I Still Call Australia Home</h2>

<p>I've been to cities that never close down, <br/>
from New York to Rio and old London town, <br/>
but no matter how far or how wide I roam, <br/>
I still call Australia home.</p> 

<p>I'm always travelIing, I love being free, <br/>
and so I keep leaving the sun and the sea, <br/>
but my heart lies waiting over the foam, <br/>
I still call Australia home. </p>

<p>All the sons and daughters spinning 'round the world, <br/>
away from their family and friends, <br/>
but as the world gets older and colder, <br/>
it's good to know where your journey ends. <br/>
Someday we'll all be together once more, <br/>
when all of the ships come back to the shore, <br/>
I�ll realise something I've always known, <br/>
I still call Australia home. </p>

<p>but no matter how far or wide I roam, <br/>
I still call Australia I still call Australia, I still call Australia home. <br/>
but no matter how far or wide I roam, <br/>
I still call Australia I still call Australia, I still call Australia home.</p>

<h2>Waltzing Matilda</h2>

<p>Once a jolly swagman camped by a billabong<br/>
Under the shade of a Coolibah tree<br/>
And he sang as he watched and waited till his billy
boiled<br/>
�Who'll come a waltzing Matilda with me?�</p>

<p>Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda<br/>
�Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?�<br/>
And he sang as he watched and waited til his billy
boiled<br/>
�Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?�</p>

<p>Down came a jumbuck to drink at that billabong<br/>
Up jumped the swagman and grabbed him with glee<br/>
And he sang as he shoved that jumbuck in his
tuckerbag<br/>
�You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me�</p>

<p>Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda<br/>
You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me<br/>
And he sang as he shoved that jumbuck in his
tuckerbag<br/>
�You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me�</p>


<p>Up rode a squatter mounted on his thoroughbred<br/>
Down came troopers one, two, three<br/>
�Who�s that jolly jumbuck you've got in the tuckerbag?<br/>
You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me!</p>

<p>Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda<br/>
You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me<br/>
Who�s that jolly jumbuck you've got in the tuckerbag?<br/>
You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me�</p>

<p>Up jumped the swagman and sprang into the billabong<br/>
�You'll never catch me alive!� said he<br/>
And his ghost may be heard as you pass by that
billabong<br/>
�You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me!�</p>

<p>Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda<br/>
You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me<br/>
And his ghost may be heard as you pass by that
billabong<br/>
�You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me!�</p>


<h2>I am Australian</h2>

<p>I came from the dreamtime from the dusty red soil plains<br/>
I am the ancient heart, the keeper of the flame<br/>
I stood upon the rocky shore<br/>
I watched the tall ships come<br/>
For forty thousand years I'd been the first Australian</p>

<p>I came upon the prison ship bowed down by iron chains.<br/>
I cleared the land, endured the lash and waited for the rains.<br/>
I'm a settler.<br/>
I'm a farmer's wife on a dry and barren run<br/>
A convict then a free man I became Australian</p>

<p>I'm the daughter of a digger who sought the mother lode<br/>
The girl became a woman on the long and dusty road<br/>
I'm a child of the depression<br/>
I saw the good times come<br/>
I'm a bushy, I'm a battler<br/>
I am Australian</p>

<p><strong>Chorus</strong><br/>
<em>We are one, but we are many<br/>
And from all the lands on earth we come<br/>
We share a dream and sing with one voice:<br/>
I am, you are, we are Australian<br/>
I am, you are, we are Australian</em></p>

<p>I'm a teller of stories<br/>
I'm a singer of songs<br/>
I am Albert Namatjira<br/>
I paint the ghostly gums<br/>
I am Clancy on his horse<br/>
I'm Ned Kelly on the run<br/>
I'm the one who waltzed Matilda<br/>
I am Australian</p>

<p>I'm the hot wind from the desert<br/>
I'm the black soil of the plains<br/>
I'm the mountains and the valleys<br/>
I'm the drought and flooding rains<br/>
I am the rock, I am the sky<br/>
The rivers when they run<br/>
The spirit of this great land<br/>
I am Australian</p>

<p><strong>Chorus</strong><br/>
<em>We are one, but we are many<br/>
And from all the lands on earth we come<br/>
We share a dream and sing with one voice:<br/>
I am, you are, we are Australian<br/>
I am, you are, we are Australian</em></p>


<h2>Give me a home among the gum trees</h2>

<p><em>Give me a home among the gum trees<br/>
With lots of plum trees<br/>
A sheep or two<br/>
A kangaroo<br/>
A clothesline out the back<br/>
Verandah out the front<br/>
And an old rocking chair</em></p>

<p>You'll see me in the kitchen<br/>
Cooking up a roast<br/>
Or vegemite on toast<br/>
Just you and me<br/>
And a cup of tea</p>

<p>And when my friends will ask me<br/>
The place that I adore<br/>
I'll tell you right away.</p>

<p><em>Give me a home among the gum trees<br/>
With lots of plum trees<br/>
A sheep or two<br/>
A kangaroo<br/>
A clothesline out the back<br/>
Verandah out the front<br/>
And an old rocking chair</em></p>


<h2>Tie me kangaroo down</h2>

<p>Watch me wallabies feed mate.<br/>
Watch me wallabies feed.<br/>
They're a dangerous breed mate.<br/>
So watch me wallabies feed.<br/>
Altogether now!</p>

<p><em>Tie me kangaroo down sport,<br/>
tie me kangaroo down.<br/>
Tie me kangaroo down sport,<br/>
tie me kangaroo down.</em></p>

<p>Keep me cockatoo cool, Curl,<br/>
keep me cockatoo cool.<br/>
Don't go acting the fool, Curl,<br/>
just keep me cockatoo cool.<br/>
Altogether now!</p>

<p>Take me koala back, Jack,<br/>
take me koala back.<br/>
He lives somewhere out on the track, Mac,<br/>
so take me koala back.<br/>
Altogether now!</p>

<p>Mind me platypus duck, Bill,<br/>
mind me platypus duck.<br/>
Don't let him go running amok, Bill,<br/>
mind me platypus duck.<br/>
Altogether now!</p>

<p>Play your digeridoo, Blue,<br/>
play your digeridoo.<br/>
Keep playing 'til I shoot thro' Blue,<br/>
play your digerydoo.<br/>
Altogether now!</p>

<p>Tan me hide when I'm dead, Fred,<br/>
tan me hide when I'm dead.<br/>
So we tanned his hide when he died Clyde,<br/>
<em>(Spoken)</em> <strong>And that's it hanging on the shed.</strong><br/>
Altogether now!</p>
