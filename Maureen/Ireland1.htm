<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>Dublin was great. It seems if one pauses to look at a map or a travel book for even a second in Ireland, someone stops and tries to help. We walked over Dublin for 2 days, in every nook and cranny, until Mike begged for mercy. Below is Trinity College, where we saw the Book of Kells and the magnificent Library. It was built by Queen Elizabeth 1, because she was worried that the population was too Catholic, and she thought the University may help convert the population to good Protestants. She also had Irish logic, because Catholics were barred from entering Trinity, so the plan didn't work too well! On the Right below is one of the many Banks of Ireland. Dublin is full of banks. They haven't heard of amalgamations yet. We liked this one because it is being overrun by ivy.<BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>Mike was more impressed by James Joyce (below), and we both liked Christchurch Cathedral. The Anglo-Norman, Strongbow, built it in 1172. The mummified cat and mouse were trapped in an organ pipe in the 1860s. They were discovered only 10 years ago. One would have thought that the organ might have sounded a little off key during the previous 130 years.<BR>

There was some debate over whether the pub was "Fitzsimon's" or "Fitzsimons". Anyway, it was a crook joint, because when we turned up at 9.30 pm for dinner, food was off.(In Dublin!) The pub below was where they filmed "My Left Foot". It is supposed to have the best Guiness in Ireland, but was full of blokes when we passed so Maureen did not want to go in. (They weren't too good looking)<BR>

Not far from our hotel, a truck managed to mount the footpath at the entrance of an old bridge on the Liffey, demolish the fence of the bridge, end up with the cabin underwater, and then burst into flames. Would you believe the driver was OK! Eleven hours later, the street was still closed, and the traffic jam unbelievable. Officials were having a great time scratching their heads for hours and hours.<BR>

<TD WIDTH="55%" VALIGN="TOP">
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>Having "done" Dublin, we went on a bus tour to Glendalough and surrounds in County Wicklow, the next day. Glendalough is magical. Saint Kevin established a monastery here in the 6<SUP>th</SUP> century, which grew into a very large teaching centre and settlement. The buildings we saw, including the church with the stone roof, date from the 10<SUP>th</SUP> to 12<SUP>th</SUP> century. It is set in a very beautiful glacial valley, with lovely woods and lakes (below). As was common in these monastic settlements, a round tower was built, about 30 metres high. Lootings were frequent occurrences over the centuries and the monks stored their valuables in the tower and then ran for their lives. They must have been a strange looking lot. The front of their heads was shaved and at the back they had a long plait. And with looks like that, they were still able to marry and have kids etc., <BR>

The view from our room is below. Not bad, is it? We then went to Fawlty Towers (sorry, the Cliff House Hotel), for dinner. The waiter had trouble coping with 2 tables of guests. He brought us the wrong entre&eacute;, told us the lamb was off (but a customer after us was served it), tried to wipe the dried food off the plates with a tea towel before giving them to us, but wasn't concerned about the greasy glasses! If we hadn't been starving... At the end of the night he charged us only about half what he should have, and we felt we earned the mistake. As it was only 10pm, we went for a lovely walk around the headland (in the picture below). Can you believe there is this much daylight at 10pm? Saw lots of wildflowers, including lots of heather (on the hill), next to beautiful pink rock.<BR>

Decided to skip the Blarney Castle, and do a walking tour of Cork instead. Below on the left is St Finbarr's (Protestant Church), and the Catholic Holy Trinity Church, which was built by the appropriately named "Pain" brothers, for Fr Theo Matthew in 1834. He was a champion of temperance and in his time, whisky production in Cork was halved. The next site on the walking tour was the Imperial Hotel, where Michael Collins spent his last night before he was ambushed and shot. As we both consulted the Lonely Planet, the priest at Holy Trinity approached us and was very helpful, like all the Irish. However, he did insist that at the Imperial they make a very good COFFEE! <BR>

Well, Kilkenny was described in all the books as the loveliest city in Ireland. Kinsale turned out to be the most wonderful town. We had lunch for 17 Euros (3 courses), at Max's Wine Bar (below). It was possibly the best meal we have ever had! Kinsale is not to be missed. <BR>

<P>Although rainy, we still managed to see some of the lovely scenery in the famous ring of Kerry. In fine weather, the Lakes around Killarney must be spectacular.  We have decided that in Australia we have very efficient dung beetles.  Although the countryside is stunning, some of the country smells here are overwhelming. Good job the greenery makes up for it.<BR>

We thought the Dingle peninsula was more beautiful than the ring of Kerry, although the weather was slightly better.  Around Ireland, you find lots of grottoes like the one below, at all sorts of unexpected places. There was a boating tragedy when we were at Dingle, and the first person the media seems to interview, is the bereaved family's priest, who is involved immediately in counselling at the scene. Must take a lot of strain off the GPs.<BR>
