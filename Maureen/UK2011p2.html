<h3>Glencoe to Cotswolds</h3>

<small>Maureen and Mike Murphy with the band at Clachaig Inn, Glen Coe</small>
</div>
<p>Remember that quick trip to the pub?&nbsp; Well, after a night where Mike Murphy and I gyrated in the pub in Glencoe till 1 am, then rose at 6 am for a 10 hour drive, &hellip;&nbsp;  At one stage, this Hungarian bloke called David?? � or something like that � picked up Mr Murphy and swung him around and around.&nbsp; I'm talking like you would pick up a baby, or carry someone over the threshold.</p>

<p>The band had been to the Gold Coast and was amazing.&nbsp; You have to understand that we did not see over 11&deg;Celsius the whole time we were in West Scotland, but we were boiling hot with all the dancing.&nbsp; We again met people from all over the planet.&nbsp; The Hungarian chap and his mother were great, and the French were fabulous.&nbsp;  Really appreciated the panadol at 6am.&nbsp; Carol's insistence that we drink the leftover wine, so we did not have to pack it, may not have been the best of ideas.</p>

</div>
<p>We did 420 miles today, and had a few stops, and crawled behind the odd tractor on the roads.&nbsp; Our only touristy stop was at Chester.&nbsp; Wow!&nbsp; This is on the other side of the Mersey to Liverpool, but what a different world.&nbsp; There are quaint buildings called "Chester Rows" which look Germanic.&nbsp; There is an amazing clock, great Roman City Walls, and a pretty minimal Roman forum.&nbsp;  Saturday afternoon it was packed, and we have to say that the shops were gorgeous.</p>

<img src="http://www.fitzsimon.com.au/Maureen/Images/2011UK/Mellowstone_th.jpg" width="300" height="169" alt="Mellowstone" /><br />
<small>Mellowstone, the "palace" where we are staying.</small>
</div>
<p>We have now landed in Paradise. Have a look at the website for the cottage where we are staying; <a href="http://www.cotswoldholiday.com/more_info.php?pid=45" title="Cotswold Property Lettings">Mellowstone</a>, 138 High St, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway,_Worcestershire">Broadway, Worcestershire</a>.&nbsp; However, the web site does not come near doing it justice.&nbsp; For instance, we now have 4 toilets and 3 bathrooms, and every little detail is luxurious, 7 star.&nbsp; There are even flowers on the enamel inside the toilet bowl.&nbsp; For &pound;30 a night each.&nbsp; We have been greeted with Australian wine, chocolates, fresh flowers, fruit, bread, milk, and a garden just bursting with flowers of so many kinds.&nbsp; We have French doors leading out to this amazing garden, yet we are in the High Street.</p>

<p>At dinner tonight, we made a toast to Dyson vacuum cleaners.&nbsp; Yes, we have one here in Broadway as well.&nbsp; In particular, we hoped that Nick�s vacuum cleaner sucks!&nbsp; (You will remember Nick as the landlord from Edinburgh).</p>

<p>After dinner, we walked down the High Street under a full moon and could not believe how cute Broadway is.&nbsp; Met a lady from Sydney, even though there are only a handful of people here.</p>

<p>Another thing we have noticed is that the English have weird names for their pubs.&nbsp; Today, we thought the pick of the bunch was <em>"The Headless Woman"</em>.&nbsp; The Mikes squared reckoned that the Aussie tendency for <em>"The Topless Woman"</em> had to be a better option.&nbsp; However, <em>"The Headless Woman"</em> would not be too bad.&nbsp; She would, after all, not answer back or tell you where to go.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, I suppose we will meet the Vicar, as it is Sunday.<br />
Cheers, Maureen.

<small>Broadway Tower</small>
</div>
<p>Very difficult to get going today, after the huge drive yesterday.&nbsp; Also, as we are now living in a palace, it is difficult to leave here.&nbsp; Did a heap of washing and indulged myself hanging it out in the glorious garden.&nbsp; Started out by going up to the hill in Broadway (our village), <a href="http://www.broadwaytower.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">where there is a tower</a>.&nbsp; Great views.&nbsp; This was built in 1799, probably as a "folly", where people built things to be future interesting "ruins".&nbsp; It was actually lived in for many years, and served as a military lookout, with nearby nuclear bunkers as well.</p>

It's not the camera. The window <strong>does</strong> lean like that.</small>
</div>
<p>We did a "Romantic" drive around the Cotswolds, moving on to the <em>"so cute you could cry"</em> village of Snowshill, then Lower Slaughter, Upper Slaughter, Temple Guiting and on to Stow-on-the-Wold.&nbsp; Just lovely.&nbsp; Had beautiful coffee and cake there, and did some shopping.&nbsp; Saw the square with a crucifix at one end and the stocks at the other.&nbsp; Then lots of other villages �  Naunton, Bourton-on-the-water and Guiting Power, and Hailes Abbey (with another abbey destroyed by our old mate, Henry VIII).&nbsp; At Stanway, there was Stanway House where even the Gatehouse was great.&nbsp; Everywhere the roads were just over one car wide.&nbsp; Luckily there were little passing bays here and there.&nbsp; It was a lovely day, about 19&deg;C and so much warmer than Scotland.</p>

<p>Tonight, we went out to an Indian Restaurant in our village, which was very nice indeed.</p>

<p>Cheers from<br />
Queen Carol, Princess Maureen, Lords Mike Squared, and Sir Ben.  at the castle, Mellowstone, Broadway.</p>

<p>Felt a bit that way myself this morning.&nbsp; Public holiday in Logan, and needing to rise early, had to have the alarm on my mobile phone turned on.&nbsp; Therefore, every man and their dog in Logan rang me, or texted me.&nbsp; All. Night. Long.&nbsp; Feeling shattered today.&nbsp; Tonight � no alarm.</p>

<p>Heard there were riots in Edinburgh the day after we left.&nbsp; There is even a YouTube video.&nbsp; Has anyone seen it?&nbsp; Please don't tell me it was our landlord attacking his cleaner with the Dyson.</p>

<p>Went to Stonehenge.&nbsp; We had seen it before (<a href="London.htm">in 2002</a>) but the Murphys hadn't.&nbsp; You should have seen the crowds.&nbsp; I suppose they are 5000 year old tourist attractions.&nbsp; Nice day too.&nbsp; Then went on to Salisbury Cathedral.&nbsp;  Spent ages there.&nbsp; All of these volunteer guides we find in the British Cathedrals are just fantastic.&nbsp; Did a guided tour, had lunch there, and bought souvenirs.&nbsp; Have to support the cause.&nbsp; (Anglicans are almost Catholics.)</p>

</div>
<p>Despite leaving home very early, the day was late.&nbsp; Then Mike F decided his OCD desires to see the chalk hills engravings were paramount.&nbsp; We travelled many, many, miles to see the <a href="http://www.visitwiltshire.co.uk/site/things-to-do/attractions/history-and-heritage/white-horses" rel="nofollow">Wiltshire White Horse at Westbury</a> and then the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uffington_White_Horse" rel="nofollow">Uffington white horse</a> sculptures.&nbsp; By then it was raining, cold, and the blokes had no trouble finding the Gents.&nbsp; (God must be a man.)&nbsp; We travelled across hill and dale around the Cotswolds.&nbsp; Carol was actually clapping and in shopping ecstasy to find a Tesco.&nbsp; We found a "Ladies" in the store, (<em>Heaven!</em>) and loaded up on groceries.&nbsp; Then arrived home and treated the blokes to a gourmet feast of home-made salad with gourmet dressing, chicken and gourmet rolls.&nbsp; With wine++.&nbsp; They are just so spoiled.</p>

<h2 id="dt20110816">Tuesday 16 August</h2>
<h3>Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwick Castle, Oxford, etc, etc</h3>

<p>We have in our midst Dark and Dastardly Dyson Sympathizers.&nbsp; Certain persons have admitted their fondness for the Dyson, and, indeed, have sent images where they are seen to be fraternizing with their beloved machines.&nbsp; Yes, we mean you, Mary.&nbsp;  Even Carol has admitted to a defensive fondness for her Dyson&nbsp; <em>"Exterminate! Exterminate!"</em></p>

<p>Forgot to include some juicy bits yesterday.&nbsp; At Salisbury Cathedral, the Altar of St Lawrence detailed how St L.  had been martyred in the usual way in the 3rd century � bar-b-qued on a plate till death! Ouch!</p>

<p>Also, in another story, Poor Mr Longespee was pretty cheezed off to find that while he had been away waging battles, a nasty type had tried to marry off Mrs Longspee to his nephew.&nbsp;  There was a banquet of reconciliation and the poor Mr Longespee kicked the bucket the day after.&nbsp; He is buried in the oldest grave (800 years old) in Salisbury Cathedral.&nbsp; A rat, discovered in his skull, tested positive for arsenic!&nbsp; Mr Longespee's wife, a clever woman, retreated to become a nun, so avoiding marrying into the murdering family.&nbsp; If only "New Idea" had existed then.</p>

<p>The Salisbury Cathedral is at the confluence of 7 rivers, so the underlying water table is vital to the structure of the Cathedral.&nbsp; To this day, they drop a "dip stick" into the floor of the Cathedral to check the water levels, and make sure it is right, so the Cathedral does not crack up.&nbsp; Good one!</p>

</div>
<p>So today, having sampled the sinister and scientific in Salisbury, we travelled via Chipping Camden to Stratford-upon-Avon and Anne Hathaway's house.&nbsp; You will remember her as the sheila that Billy Shakespeare caused to have a bun in the oven, so then married.&nbsp; Her brother, Bartholomew, eventually bought the property from the feudal landlord and renovated it extensively.&nbsp; The volunteer guides were very entertaining, and the garden was to the standard of Monet's garden in France.&nbsp; Not only that, but we bought 3 souvenir tea towels for the price of two, so is that excellent or what?</p>

<p>Then on to Warwick Castle.&nbsp; Mike Xavier Murphy, as an accountant, should have baulked at the &pound;21 entrance fee.&nbsp; Fortunately, he did not.&nbsp;  (He knows value when he sees it!)&nbsp; This place even had an annual multi-visit fee.&nbsp; We figured out that the locals pay this in lieu of a gym membership fee, as it was about 6 km from the car park to the castle.&nbsp;  Uphill.&nbsp; We were totally knackered by the time we arrived at the entrance, hence, Mike X Murphy�s compliance with such a huge fee.</p>

<small>Archer. This guy was GOOD! Casually grouping half a dozen arrows on a playing card.</small>
</div>
<p>It was so worth it!&nbsp; After all, we are big kids.&nbsp; In 1978, Madame Tausauds bought the place.&nbsp; At first I thought, "this could be tacky".&nbsp; Turned out it was excellent.&nbsp; It was all a castle "Dreamworld".&nbsp; Jousting displays, archery displays.&nbsp; You name it � it was on.&nbsp; There were actors and actresses everywhere bringing the castle to life.&nbsp; Henry VIII was brilliant. Just so entertaining.&nbsp;  The wax figures were so lifelike, at times it was difficult to tell the actors from the waxtors.</p>

<p>Overall, we had a blast.&nbsp; We talked to all the actors and actresses, joined in with Henry VIII, and loved it all.&nbsp; Craig � you have to spend a whole day here.&nbsp; It is the best medieval experience in the world.&nbsp; We have informed the very precise head archer of your name, and he is waiting for you.&nbsp; Also the shoemaker.</p>

<p>Then � went to Oxford.&nbsp; Blooming difficult finding a park.&nbsp; We are absolutely certain of receiving an upcoming fine for transgressing the central traffic area.&nbsp; Yes, the parking Fascists will be looking for our money!&nbsp;  Eventually found a parking station at Tescos, and caught a bus, with lots of the locals taking pity on us, and helping us into the city.&nbsp; Unfortunately, missed Christ Church entry (Harry Potter fame), but did all of the rest.&nbsp; Walked all over the place and saw all of the famous Oxford Colleges and other sites.&nbsp; Wow!&nbsp; Should have taken up that scholarship; except it was never offered!</p>

<p>Took a taxi back to Tescos (a blue taxi, not the way cool one we saw with the periodic table all over it), and headed off to great villages like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Tew" rel="nofollow">Great Tew</a>, Chipping Norton, Morton in Marsh, a glimpse of Blenheim palace (where Winston Churchill was born) and eventually arrived back in our palace at 8:45 pm.&nbsp; Served up a salmon banquet to the men-who-must-chauffeur-us, and now are ready to collapse.</p>

<h3>Bath</h3>
<p>This was our Bath day.&nbsp; Cut the jokes about the English and frequency of having a bath!&nbsp; They have even named a whole city after their penchant for bathing.</p>
</div>

<p>Mike and I were in Bath in 2002, on a day trip from London.&nbsp; Back then, (Oh so long ago!), we saw the main pool and the level above and that was about all folks.</p>

<p>Today's tour took us 2 hours � just to do the <a href="http://www.romanbaths.co.uk/how_to_find_us.html">Roman baths</a>.&nbsp; They had excavated so much more than in 2002, and their audio tour and visuals were simply superb.&nbsp; This whole complex would have occupied a football field.&nbsp; The roof was as high as the nearby multistorey buildings. It would have been a buzzing, colourful, and busy place.&nbsp; After sacrificing the odd lamb, the smell of the bar-b-que would have certainly tempted the gods � as planned.&nbsp; There were many pools, and inside it was heated, with very sophisticated plumbing and engineering.&nbsp; It will take many years to uncover the whole site, as the current ground level is 4 metres higher than in Roman times.</p>

<p>On returning to our village of Broadway, Carol and I made souvenir seller's lives very well worth living.&nbsp; We then went to the "Horse and Hound" for dinner.&nbsp; Magnificent pub food.&nbsp; Then a walk around the village at sunset.&nbsp; Sublime!</p>

<p>The ongoing saga of the Dyson Vacuum cleaner is continuing to unfold.&nbsp; Confessions of ownership of these devices have been coming thick and fast.&nbsp; In the latest development to hand, we have photographic evidence of Mary's Dyson having gone feral.&nbsp;  A disturbing image was emailed to us, of one of Mary's friends, her father, and the Dyson each downing a beer.&nbsp; The Dastardly Dyson was even wearing a bow tie.&nbsp; Some say the machine's resemblance to Sean Connery is uncanny, which may explain why Mary was seen longingly looking at her Dyson in a previous Emailed photograph.&nbsp; David Tennant's expertise in these matters has been sought.&nbsp; We will bring you new developments as they come to hand.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, off to Cornwall.&nbsp; So sad to leave our cottage in Paradise.</p>

<h2 id="dt20110818">Thursday 18 August</h2>
<h3>Cotswolds to Cornwall</h3>
<p>Carol committed a felony and left the scene of the crime.&nbsp; Shocking but true.&nbsp; Some miles down the road, she showed remorse.&nbsp; She claims, having just had a birthday with large numbers, that her memory failed her.</p>

<p>We had just been to the Periwinkle tea rooms in a village so cute you could weep, at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selworthy" rel="nofollow">Selworthy</a> in Exmoor National Park in Wessex.&nbsp; The day was slow to start, as we did not leave our mansion in Broadway until 11 am.&nbsp; We had begun the journey on the M5 motorway, previously traversed by our group, and the weather was doing the English cats and dogs thing. So we bypassed Cheddar Gorge.&nbsp; A great sadness for Carol, our cheese fanatic.</p>

<p>The day then cleared, and we decided to go the scenic route to our hotel in Port Isaac in Cornwall.&nbsp; Such a lovely drive.&nbsp; For instance, we had not seen heather like we saw today, and we certainly saw heather in Scotland.&nbsp; Huge hills and dales of purple with bright yellow and white wildflowers interspersed, obviously at their most glorious.&nbsp; The coastal landscape was divine. Not your Aussie sandy beach affair, but one of towering cliffs plunging into the sea.&nbsp; The backdrop to all of this consisted of the greenest pastures, with sheep, cows and stonewalls fences, interspersed with thatched cottages and castles.</p>

</div>
<p>Which brings us to the scene of the crime.&nbsp; We were thirsting for a cuppa, and saw a sign to Periwinkle tea rooms, just off the beaten track abutting the forest.&nbsp; Like a little piece of Paradise, lemon thatched cottages sat amongst flowers, with a cute little church binding the scene together.&nbsp; The tea rooms offered pure indulgence.&nbsp; We had never seen such thick cream, such warm light scones, such delectable home-made jam, such beautiful crockery, such superb tea.&nbsp; All in a lovely garden with vistas from heaven.</p>

<p>I paid Carol for my share and Mike's, and we all levitated to the car in ecstasy.</p>

<p>Some miles down the road, Carol suddenly confessed, <em>"We(I) didn't pay!"</em>&nbsp; Thinking that sirens and arrest were imminent, and we would be deported to the colonies (via Malaysia), we braked in a cloud of dust and gravel and returned to the scene of the crime.&nbsp; That hussy, Queen Carol, just sashayed into the tea rooms, and loftily settled the bill without so much as a feeble excuse.</p>

<small>Aerial Ambulance, Clovelly</small>
</div>
<p>On we motored, gasping and groaning (No! not the scones, jam and cream at fault), but the scenery. Breathtaking.&nbsp; You should have seen the twin villages of Lynton and Lynmouth!&nbsp; A 1 in 4 grade of the road down and up.&nbsp; Our 1.6 litre diesel station wagon, with 5 passengers and luggage was really grunting.</p>

<p>Had read about the "private" village of Clovelly.&nbsp; Sounded lovely.&nbsp; So made a small diversion to explore. As we arrived at the car park, more drama!&nbsp; A helicopter was landing in the field, and an ambulance arriving for rendezvous. Carol and I volunteered assistance, but the lady with an allergic reaction to a wasp bit looked fine.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the really funky big red helicopter whisked her off to hospital in great drama against a perfect blue sky.</p>

<p>We learnt that "private" meant that one bloke owned the whole village and, in order to enter, you have to pay six pounds.&nbsp; Blow that! We had our fun and left, after a sandwich picnic out of the back of the car.</p>

<p>Arrived in Port Isaac, having traversed hair-raising little roads, with nil visibility due to hedges rising from the road verges on each side for miles.&nbsp;  Many of the roads we have travelled in England are so narrow, they make Fraser Island look easy driving.</p>

</div>
<p>It was all worth it.&nbsp; We are staying in the <a href="http://www.theoldschoolhotel.co.uk/index.html">The Old School</a>, Fore St, Port Isaac, aka "Port Wen" in the "Doc Martin" series.&nbsp;  Doc Martin's surgery is across the cove from our bedroom windows.&nbsp; The hotel is tiny, basic, but very friendly.&nbsp; It is all so cute and beautiful, we have to pinch ourselves that we are here.</p>

<p>Went to the pub for dinner, looking over the lovely harbour, and had haddock and pasties.&nbsp; (We are in Cornwall!).&nbsp;  Then had a walk after dinner, enjoying the brass band of St Something-or-other�s, playing near the harbour, raising money for the Red Cross.</p>

<p>Since arriving in England, we have found each shopkeeper, including here, examines the bank notes we give them very carefully.&nbsp; Rather insulting, you would think.&nbsp; This ritual has only recently been explained to us.&nbsp; We withdrew cash in Scotland.&nbsp; Now the banks in Scotland each print their own notes. So you have many different types of notes from each bank.&nbsp; In order to check if they are counterfeit, English shopkeepers pull out a huge chart- like 5 feet by 2.5 feet, and check!&nbsp; What a system!</p>

<p>Hope the weather holds up for tomorrow,</p>

<p>Love to all, from the Colonials,<br />

<p>We had many wonderful experiences on our full day here in Cornwall.&nbsp;  For a start, the weather was glorious. 21&deg;C and blue skies all day.&nbsp;  Rose early and did a big walk up and down every street from here to the next town.&nbsp; I can tell you there is a lot of up! The fishing vessels and crew were the only sign of life until about 8am.&nbsp; It is such a snoozy place.&nbsp; Of course, we have spied <em>Doc Martin</em>'s house, and Louisa's.&nbsp; It will take a week to get through all of the photographs, we were so snap happy.</p>

</div>
<p>Then went on to have lunch at Rick Stein's <a href="http://www.rickstein.com/The-Seafood-Restaurant.html">The Seafood Restaurant</a> at Padstow.&nbsp; The town was very crowded and the only parking spot we could find featured the car each side "on the line", so in order for Mike to get out of the car, we had to park very close (to the passenger side) of the car next door.&nbsp; As it is, English parking spaces are so much smaller than Aussie ones, so everything was very tight.&nbsp; On returning to the car after lunch, we reviewed an hilarious note from the driver who had parked on the line, written on a page torn out from a child�s story book, possibly from a "Macdonalds".&nbsp;  The background of the page contained:"Lenny the Lion Bravery Award", and "Heppy and her friends find their way home", with a world map.&nbsp; The sweet musings of our happy driver read, in block letters: <em>"YOU SELFISH INCONSIDERATE BASTARD TWAT"</em>.&nbsp; Bet that made him feel really good!</p>

<p>Later in the day, Mike M. was driving down a very, very narrow road, with stone walls each side, when another English driver, in a large car with headlights on, simply pushed Mike to reverse backwards a considerable distance, all the while maintaining very little space between the cars.&nbsp; Must have been "Cranky British Driver Day."</p>

<p>All of this was vastly eclipsed by many great things, which happened on this glorious day.&nbsp; Firstly, the big one:</p>

<p><strong>We met Rick Stein</strong> and had quite a chat to him.&nbsp; He was genuinely delightful, and told us he would be in Australia next week (and New Zealand).&nbsp;  Not only that but the food we enjoyed at his restaurant at lunch time was simply divine, as was the service.</p>

</div>
<p>After a photo, we headed off to Land�s End, via Penzance.&nbsp; Now at about the same time, our friend, Mary was seeing Jon English in concert, and I am sure we have all enjoyed seeing him in <em>The Pirates of Penzance</em>.&nbsp;  In the town, we also located the pirate on the roof of the "Admiral Benbow Inn" where Jack Hawkins met the pirate in <em>Treasure Island</em>.</p>

<p>Then off to see another St Michael's Mount.&nbsp; It was low tide, so the castle on the island could be accessed.&nbsp; It looked just beautiful shining in the sun against a blue sky.&nbsp; The crowds of English were out turning red in the sun, roasting in the Qld winter temperatures, and playing on the gravelly beach.</p>

<p>The road we took to Lands End was definitely the scary one � talk about narrow and winding!&nbsp; It took ages, but was very scenic.&nbsp; Then, on to a better road to travel home.</p>

<p>In Port Isaac, they have a concert on the beach on Friday nights.&nbsp;  We had a very light meal in the Old School Restaurant, and a little walk amongst the throngs.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, we head back to London, to drop off Carol, Mike M and Ben, then we head to Brighton for the night.</p>

<h2 id="dt20110820">Saturday 20 August</h2>
<h3>Cornwall to London to Brighton</h3>
<p>Sadly, our last day touring with clan Murphy.&nbsp; We have had a simply splendid time, far exceeding expectations, although not sure what we expected.&nbsp; The best bit was having such wonderful friends with us.&nbsp; Poor Ben had to put up with not one, but TWO sets of parents.&nbsp; He soldiered on valiantly.&nbsp; We ended up seeing far more than we dreamed of seeing, and ate like The Royalty we are, on less than a Logan budget.&nbsp; As Carol says, it was all a dream. </p>

<p>Yesterday, just as we finished our fantastic gastronomic experience at Rick Stein's, Carol received the news that her mother had passed away.&nbsp; Only minutes later, we met Rick Stein, and Carol certainly put on a brave persona.&nbsp; Carol had been anxiously wondering whether such a sad phone call would arrive for most of our holiday.&nbsp; Her mother was 96 years old, and had been in deteriorating health since March.&nbsp; However, it is always a shock and a huge loss, when that phone call comes.</p>

<p>For the rest of the day she soldiered on and toured as we had planned, and we cannot believe how selfless a person she was in doing so.&nbsp; She will try to board an earlier flight, although she is booked on Tuesday anyway, so that is also OK.</p>

<p>So, this morning we left the magical village of Port Isaac, the home of "Doc Martin".&nbsp; Carol stocked up with Cornish Pasties, and other Cornish delicacies from the local shop.&nbsp; Dinner tonight in London!</p>

<p>The drive to London was through some heavy rain, car accidents (fortunately, not us), and again past the traffic jams at Stonehenge.&nbsp; (Been there, done that 3 times now!)&nbsp; At least the roads were wider than our car!&nbsp; Nice change!&nbsp; And at least driving did not bring back memories of the movie "Duel" - like yesterday!</p>

<p>After lunch, the day cleared to beautiful blue skies, and we ground our way through London streets and dropped the Murphy clan to Ben's pad in Lewisham.&nbsp; Carol is soon back to Aussieland, and Mike Murphy will join our lovely friends, Peter and Debbie Heiner, for a cycling holiday in the Loire Valley. </p>

<p>We have continued on to <a href="http://www.thekelvin.co.uk/">Kelvin House B&amp;B in Brighton</a>.&nbsp; Just lovely.&nbsp; I am now sitting in <a href="http://www.fishyfishy.co.uk">Fishy Fishy</a> Restaurant, eating crab, lobster and Gurnard(sp?) fish.&nbsp; Someone has to do it!&nbsp; Our gay landlords have warned us not to be shocked by all the gayness around us.&nbsp; What!!</p>

<p>Planning to just walk and chill out tomorrow,</p>

<p>Cheers,<br />
Maureen.</p>

<h3>Brighton</h3>
<p>Our first day without the Murphys. Decided to just walk everywhere and not drive at all.  Carol is flying home tomorrow, and does not have the hassle of a long time in Brunei, thanks to finding a Qantas flight. I�m sure she is relieved.</p>

<p>We hear that in London, as here, it was a beautiful day, 23&deg;C.&nbsp; The sea breeze here made a cardigan useful.&nbsp;  The beach in Brighton is made up of stones � average 5cm.&nbsp; Good job it does not get hot � you can imagine what that would feel like in bare feet.&nbsp; Some were swimming, and loads of people were out and about, enjoying the sunshine.</p>

</div>
<p>First stop was the Royal Pavilion.&nbsp; Stunning!&nbsp; Have never seen anything like it.&nbsp; Indian on the outside, with lots of "onion domes", and Chinese on the inside.&nbsp; The extravagant George IV commissioned John Nash in 1815 to transform his house into a lavish Oriental Palace.&nbsp; It was amazing!&nbsp; The crystal chandelier in the dining room was just massive, and held in the claws of a dragon.&nbsp; Puccini once played in the Music room.&nbsp; You would have to see it to even begin to imagine such opulence.&nbsp; Even the kitchen was breathtaking!&nbsp; However, Queen Victoria (George's  niece with 9 children), found it too small (!!!) and sold it to Brighton City Council in 1850.&nbsp; Good buy!&nbsp; Just to see the stables (now a museum), was pretty special.</p>

<p>The Brighton pier is quite long, and much like Santa Monica, only longer.&nbsp; Loads of rides, as in the Ekka or Dreamworld.&nbsp; Heaps cheaper, however.&nbsp; Also pubs and other shops along the pier.&nbsp; We walked along and back and eventually caught the world's oldest working electric train � the Volks.&nbsp; It has been running since 1883, and tours for about 1km or more along the waterfront.&nbsp; Then we walked to the Marina.&nbsp; Like Manly, but with a big defensive wall.&nbsp;  After walking till our feet dropped off, we retreated to our hotel for a short rest, before venturing out for dinner.</p>

<p>Went to a Polish Restaurant only about 100 metres from the hotel, Nasza.&nbsp; Had the best, tastiest and leanest Pork pot roast on the planet.&nbsp; Mike had salmon; obviously not a Polish specialty.&nbsp; It was burnt on the bottom and dry.&nbsp;  Then we walked down to the Pier again to look at it lit up at night.</p>

<p>Certain things are important when travelling.&nbsp; One is a comfortable bed.&nbsp; Here at Kelvin Guest House, the bed is just lovely, even though the rooms are small.&nbsp; This contrasts with our mansion in the Cotswolds; so beautiful, so spacious, so well appointed, but what a crummy bed!</p>

<p>Secondly, the different showers drive me nuts!&nbsp; They are too weak, too hot, too cold, have poor direction, no shower curtain, too small etc.&nbsp; In Port Isaac, the shower head had to be held in the hand, with nowhere to hook it up.&nbsp; Carol managed to wet most of Cornwall, including her fresh clothes.&nbsp; Poor soul had to resort to wearing shorts again, with consequent frostbite.&nbsp; I was too scared to even attempt it, and ran a bath.&nbsp;  Here in Brighton, we finally have a sensible shower.&nbsp; Yeah!</p>

<p>Tomorrow off to Thetford, halfway between Norwich and Cambridge.</p>

<p>Love,<br />
The Twats,<br />
Mike and Maureen.</p>

<h3>Brighton to Norfolk</h3>
<p>That�s it!&nbsp; Talk about twatty!&nbsp; Today, we went to Leeds Castle.&nbsp; Thirsty, we went straight to the shop to buy a drink.&nbsp; Again&hellip; yes AGAIN&hellip; dear readers, these people looked down their nose at our money.&nbsp; So far down their nose that they refused to take it!&nbsp; After some discussion about the definition of "legal tender", they remained steadfast.&nbsp; Of course, I threatened a High Court challenge, at the very least.&nbsp; This is "colonial abuse".&nbsp; Bring on the Republic, I say!</p>

<p>Would you believe that it was not a Kingdom of Scotland note which had aroused their suspicions?&nbsp; Queen Liz was certainly and wanly smiling on the proffered note.&nbsp; Apparently, my 5 pound note was "old currency", and the company policy was only to take "new" money.&nbsp; The young lad agreed that the value of my scoffed at currency was indeed, five pounds.&nbsp; Just not a good enough five pound note for the hoity toity lot at Leeds Castle.</p>

<p>Of course, I told them that if my 5 pounds was not good enough for them, then neither was the 18 pound admission (each).&nbsp;  I�ll teach this lot to be snobbish about their tender.</p>

<p>So I pranced off.&nbsp; Nose in the air (of course).&nbsp; Did not mention that I thought their castle was overpriced and bad value for money, and I wouldn�t have parted with my hard earned remuneration anyway?&nbsp; So there!&nbsp; That fixed them.&nbsp; Will <a href="http://www.leeds-castle.com" rel="nofollow">look at their silly castle on the internet</a>.&nbsp; Or ask Wicki at work!</p>

<p>Isn�t a good rant wonderful?</p>

<small>The House Opposite the Mermaid Inn at Rye (durr!)</small>
</div>
<p>Anyway, we had left interesting Brighton, and crawled our way eastwards along the coast, towards Eastbourne, then Hastings.&nbsp; Looked for the boxes which store the fishermens' nets.&nbsp; Found somewhat largeish, but colourful bathing boxes.&nbsp; Also lots of white cliffs, a la Dover, which was a little further along.&nbsp; Found the "Conquest Hospital".&nbsp; Sorry to disappoint these poor blighters but&hellip; William the Conquerer from Normandy (ie the FROGS), beat you guys.&nbsp; In fact, he put an arrow through the eye of poor Harold.&nbsp; I would call this a "Defeat Hospital".&nbsp; I admit this is not very encouraging to patients, but history is history, after all.</p>

<p>Stopped at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rye,_East_Sussex" rel="nofollow">Rye in East Sussex</a>.&nbsp; What a delightful village.&nbsp; The cuteness meter was dinging loudly.&nbsp; The pub in Rye, the Mermaid Inn, was built in 1420.&nbsp; In the 1750s it was the headquarters of notorious and bloodthirsty smugglers called the Hawkhurst gang.&nbsp; So notorious were they, the English have named a nearby town after them.&nbsp; Crime pays!&nbsp; So proud that my patient of the same name, is of the same ilk!&nbsp; Go, Logan!&nbsp; There was a city wall and the Ypres tower, the only corner tower of the wall remaining.&nbsp; Everything was again bursting with flowers, even the "<strong>D</strong>Rye Cleaner" (get it?)&nbsp; Beautiful.</p>

</div>
<p>Then went on to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodiam_Castle">Bodiam Castle</a>.&nbsp; Just lovely.&nbsp; Crawling with children on school holidays.&nbsp; Fairytale-like, with a wonderful moat and delicious reflections.</p>

<p>Encountered a horrible traffic jam.&nbsp; No mathematician would ever be able to calculate the length of such a queue.&nbsp; So went in the opposite direction, towards Canterbury.&nbsp; Almost to the famous Cathedral.&nbsp; Then on to the M2, under the Dartford tunnel, and to freedom north.&nbsp; Past Stansted, and past Cambridge, arriving in the <a href="http://www.glebecountryhouse.co.uk/">Glebe Country House</a> B&amp;B in Elveden, near Thetford.</p>

<p>Lovely.&nbsp; Secluded.&nbsp; Huge bedroom.&nbsp; The waitress in the nearby "Old Bull Inn" at Barton Mills (must be Peter Mills' relative) had a grandmother living in Sunnybank who had passed away recently.&nbsp; Of course, the waitress was planning to escape the English weather with her mother and flee to Queensland asap.&nbsp; She even accepted a tip in old English money.&nbsp; What a sport!</p>

<h3>Norfolk</h3>
<p>Tomorrow evening we leave the shores of the motherland � that place which thankfully kicked out my ancestor, Aaron Peckham and his dear wife, Louisa.&nbsp; He deserved his passage - Aaron stole a horse, so in 1790 arrived with the second fleet to New South Wales.</p>

<p>Mike�s lot apparently escaped from Scotland � the  McGrory clan.&nbsp; Who knows when!</p>

<p>Of course, mixed up over all of these years we have had the Irish, the Dutch and the German into our gene pool.&nbsp; Especially esteemed is our adopted Hungarian Patriarch.</p>

<p>As a bit of a frog, I have found the weather a challenge, at times.&nbsp; In Summer!&nbsp; However, the history, the friendliness of the people, the flowers and the architecture have been simply wonderful.</p>

<p>When I was young, the first few days I worked full time on my feet in the school and Uni holidays at Woollies, I whinged about sore feet.&nbsp; Then, I adjusted, and all was good.&nbsp; Why is it then, that as each day of walking&hellip; walking&hellip; walking proceeds on holidays at this age, everything just hurts more?&nbsp; What?&nbsp; Getting old you say?&nbsp; Certainly have to do all this while we still can!</p>

<p>Today, we went to Norwich.&nbsp;  This was the second city of England until the Industrial Revolution.&nbsp; The weather was English, but we were mostly indoors.&nbsp; Saw where my friend, Peter Mills, went to school.&nbsp; (The Cathedral School, now <a href="http://www.norwich-school.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">Norwich School</a>).&nbsp; Suffice to say it was rather different to MacGregor State High School.&nbsp; When I started there, not only did we not even have a single library book, we didn't even have a concrete path.&nbsp; Oh the mud!&nbsp; Peter says he was so young, that he did not notice how beautiful it all was, and I was so young, I did not miss what I did not have.&nbsp; I suppose you mostly remember the people.&nbsp; Therefore, I have great memories of lovely friends and great teachers.</p>

<p>As usual, the people helping out in the Cathedral were wonderful.&nbsp;  To think that it dates from 1096! Bishop Losinga founded it.&nbsp;  (I suppose he is guy who invented Strepsils?)&nbsp;  Bits have been added over the centuries, and the wonderful ceiling has recently been restored.&nbsp; We saw the little boys practicing in the choir, and I was the recipient of some cheeky little grins.</p>

<p>There are some lovely medieval streets, like Elm Hill.&nbsp; Tombland is an old Saxon market place.&nbsp; Some parts of the 14th century flint City Wall still survive.</p>

<p>Then we went on to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimes_Graves" rel="nofollow">Grimes Graves</a>.&nbsp; This is one of the most important Neolithic sites in England.&nbsp;  Flint was mined here for tools, and 433 shafts have been discovered dating back to 2000 BC.&nbsp; We went down a 30 foot ladder into a mine shaft to see the tunnels (galleries) where the flint was mined.&nbsp;  There were only about 6 visitors here.&nbsp; Just as well, because only one person at a time is allowed on the ladder.&nbsp; Such a change from the throngs at all the other "tourist" attractions.</p>

<p>Finally, I did a wander around our little village of Elveden.&nbsp; Such a big church for such a small place!</p>

<p>Now off to "The Little Chef" Restaurant near here.&nbsp; This chain is apparently a notch up from Maccas.&nbsp; Heston Blumenthal renovated their menus a couple of years ago.</p>

<p>Have just heard the news.&nbsp; No not Gadaffi.&nbsp; Kate Winslett.&nbsp; Wow!&nbsp; Imagine carrying Richard Branson�s mother out from the fire.&nbsp; This will have to be a movie.</p>

<h2 id="dt20110824">Wednesday 24 August</h2>
<h3>Cambridge, LHR and home</h3>
<p>Sitting in Heathrow airport.&nbsp; An hour until boarding.&nbsp; What a fabulous holiday.&nbsp; Are we lucky� or what?</p>

<p>Have to give a special thanks to our good friend, Mary Pease, who provided our holiday comedy.&nbsp; Each day, without fail, Mary�s emails were simply hilarious.&nbsp; Carol and I checked our �inbox� repeatedly, waiting for our daily thrill.&nbsp; Thanks Mary.&nbsp; In return we visited 1,679,253 Churches called �St Mary�s�.&nbsp; Missed lighting candles for you in one or two.&nbsp; Honestly, your namesake makes McDonald�s restaurants look like a rare find.</p>

<p>Today, left the lovely Glebe Country B &amp; B in Elvesham (near Thetford).&nbsp; Thanks to Deidre for a lovely HUGE room, comfortable bed, big breakfast, and great value.</p>

<p>Went to Cambridge.&nbsp; As you have all seen on the telly, the idea of going to Cambridge is that you stand in a boat, with a long pole, and push your little boat along the little creek next to Cambridge.&nbsp;  In the Uni holidays, the students are particularly keen on doing this for tourists who will part with their money.</p>

<p>A very strong girl, called Lucy, who was quite comfortable in a sleeveless dress (while the rest of us were in coats), pushed  10 tourists along the river, while giving an expert commentary.&nbsp; Highly recommended.</p>

<p>Christ Church College was right up there.&nbsp; Especially the roof- Wow!&nbsp; Henry VI was on the right track when he began the building.&nbsp; Henry VIII finished it.&nbsp; Such a change for Henry VIII.&nbsp; He was pretty fond of demolishing most of England during his reign.&nbsp;  His initials, with those of Anne Boleyn, are everywhere in the d�cor.&nbsp; Then he had her beheaded.&nbsp; As you do.</p>

<p>Prince Charles went to Trinity College at Cambridge.&nbsp; After Oxford rejected him.&nbsp; He was warned that he would get no special treatment.&nbsp; So he arrived in a helicopter with 2 bodyguards, and was given a suite of 25 rooms.&nbsp; The bodyguards went everywhere with him, and ended up taking all the exams for fun.&nbsp; Guess who came last?&nbsp; Must have been the previous education at Geelong Grammar that caused the problem.</p>

<p>As the sun started to blaze to a record 22C, we headed for Heathrow.&nbsp; So here we are.</p>

<p>Have to say, the English have been very welcoming, and we have been blessed with so many good times here.&nbsp; Will be sad to leave, but good to be home.&nbsp; (Except for the 2564 items of mail, 1 million Emails etc., awaiting).&nbsp; The only big omission in our itinerary has been Wales.&nbsp; You can�t do it all.</p>

<p>Hope everyone has been happy and well while we have been away.<br />
Looking forward to seeing you all,</p>

<p>Love, <br />
Maureen and Mike
