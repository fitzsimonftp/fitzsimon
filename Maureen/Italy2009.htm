<h1>Fitzsimon Tour of Italy 2009</h1>
<h2>(&hellip; with a Hong Kong stopover on the way home.)</h2>
<p>
Sunday 28th June
</p>
<p>
Sitting in Hong Kong airport. What a holiday! Said sad goodbyes to Brenda and Andy. Don't know when we shall see them again. Hopefully, we will share a few days together in October.
</p>
<p>
Can't wait to deal with my mail, which should be a metre high. As usual, Mike has been glued to his phone and his emails all holiday, but I try to have a break and it is all so expensive to access when overseas. Will now reap what I have sown.

<p>
This weekend it has been rainy. We slowed down. I could not get accustomed to the time change until today, so not sleeping well. Mike can and does sleep anywhere and anytime. Went out to see the <a href="http://www.discoverhongkong.com/eng/events/harbour-light-show.html">light show on Hong Kong harbour</a> and then to a great "hot pot" restaurant last night. Different and brilliant. (<a href="http://www.global-report.com/hongkong/?l=en&a=354282">Hotpot Express</a>, 1/F, 21-23 Hillwood Rd., Tsim Sha Tsui, 3520-3800)

<p>
Today, we went to Stanley, and enjoyed the markets and a wonderful seafood lunch.
</p>
<p>
Hong Kong is wonderful to visit. So much to do. Andy has even taken a pair of Mike's trousers to have the local tailors copy a few times and send to Australia.

see you soon<br />

Friday 26th June<br />
<p>
If Italy was busy, Hong Kong is frantic!  Brenda had mapped out suggestions of things for us to do each day. The first day, we accidentally covered two days of her itinerary.
</p>
<p>
Having an absolutely wonderful time. There is no detectable pollution, but there are some nice breezes, keeping the air clean.  Also, the recession has helped the amount of Chinese pollution. 
</p>
<p>
Have tried to give Andy a bit of space the last couple of days. He is finishing up with his job with �Red Hat� and has also started with a new company, and on probation. Working from home, it is quite distracting, having Rob here, so Rob has hung around with the oldies. Many Chinese point to the three of us and cleverly remark on �Mum, Dad and Son!) (All these Aussies look alike!)
</p>
<p>
Andy is going to see how the new job goes, before Brenda resigns in Hong Kong. He will be working in Guangzhou (in my days of school geography it was called �Canton�) He will be living in Guangzhou during the week, and travelling back to Hong Kong at weekends. Brenda has to give two months notice, as she has an executive position.  In Guangzhou, she will set up her own company.

<p>
We did lots of touristy things in Hong Kong on Wednesday.  Started with the magnificent �Peak� Tram. Views from the top were just stunning. Over 120 years old, and still a fantastic tram. Then did markets, like the �Ladies Market, Fish Market, and Flower Market.� At one stage, a seller took us into a dingy building, and up 17 floors to see fake copies of designer handbags. Really tacky quality. For nice ones, Hong Kong is as expensive as Australia, but I bought one as my souvenir, and one for a gift. Finding our way around was often confusing. We found Andy�s map hard to read. However, the trick was to just stand around with the map unfolded looking concerned. People just flock to you, and help with directions. So no need to really read the map at all. Just pretend.

<p>
Went to dinner at a noodle place near Soho, and did a big walk around the Lan Kwai Fong area with Brenda and Andy. There is a huge escalator, 800 metres long, in sections, going up the hill. Saw the night club area, with Aussies, Poms and Yanks hanging out. The Haagen-Daz was to die for at the end! As we had walked solidly for 12 hours plus, any excuse to sit down would have been good!

<p>
On Thursday, we went to <strong>Macau</strong>. Recommended by Noela L�Estrange. She is right, as always. It was a great, long, but relaxing day. Very strange political situation. Became a part of China in 1999. However, you still need passports, immigration forms, and the eternal health questionnaires with measurement of body temperature.  You can have as many children as you like, and the leader of the area is actually democratically elected. Also capitalism is alive and well. It is the only area of China with Casinos. And do they do well or what? MGM recently spent over a billion dollars on a new casino and recouped its capital in just over a year.

<p>
Decided to do an organized tour, as we were so tired. Met a great chap called Steve, (aren�t all Steves great?) a government registered tour guide. For $40 each he drove us around in his air-conditioned car, and showed us everything. Could probably have beaten him down in price, but I always feel sorry for them. He gave us great value, and we loved it all. It is so neat, interesting and very attractive.  Finished up around 4.30 pm and we were starving. He took us to <a href="http://www.yp.com.mo/praiagrande/intro_e.html">Praia Grande</a>, a Portuguese restaurant, which was a trip highlight. Not expensive. Great traditional Portuguese and Macanese food. At that hour, we were the only ones there. The Filipino waiters serenaded us. We danced. Left when it was dark, and saw the lights of the 33 Casinos. If I was an architect, my dream job would be a brief which said � �you have unlimited money, and you have to make the building visually stunning and exciting�. Such is the life of a Casino architect. Pity about the gambling aspect.  More immigration, health and customs forms and we toddled back to Hong Kong at a late hour.

<br /><small>Shenzhen: Tired shoppers ... with the new suitcase Maureen had to buy to carry all the loot.</small></div>

<p>
Today, we went to China. The proper China. <strong>Shenzhen</strong>. This time they took Rob�s temperature and told him to sit to one side on a chair. After a while, they measured it again and let him go! For real! In my travels I have seen some heavy tactics from shopkeepers, but these people are unbelievable. I told one girl, that her persistence will one day make her President of China. They kept on bobbing up! Did quite a bit of shopping, and it was somewhat cheaper than Australia, where I get no time to shop. Of course, the clothes were size 10. However, handbags and shoes were in abundance. Luckily, I have small feet! Even Mike bought a new pair of shoes.  As we have such small bags, we had to buy a suitcase to carry it all.  That was a second, and really cheap. Went to a lovely Dim Sum Restaurant in Shenzhen, and the food was the best I have ever tasted. Once again, combined lunch and dinner at 4pm. Very cheap. The Chinese are so polite and friendly, everywhere we go. Especially in the real Communist China. Then lots of immigration and health declaration forms and queues, the MRT, the ferry and we are now back at Andy�s and it is 11 pm.
</p>
</div>


<p>
It has been very, very humid, but was better in Macau. A few spits of rain tonight. The swine flu scare has made quite an impact here. Almost everyone who serves you, cleans, or is in reception, wears a mask. Many others do too. Children are made to wear them. Surfaces on ferries, toilets, shopping centres etc., are constantly cleaned!!
</p>
<p>
Another quirky thing is that people drive on the left, but always walk on the right, ride the escalators on the right etc., The escalators move so fast! I have always hated going down them. Have had to improve my hopping on them skills, quite a bit. [Andy's comment: <em>It's funny when Mum hesitates getting on an escalator. Five little Chinese guys do a nose-to-tail behind her and end up riding the escalator uncomfortably close to each other.</em>]
</p>
<p>
Spending the whole weekend with Andy and Brenda during the day. Have to move out of the YMCA prison in the morning, and have booked into a hotel in Tsim Sha Tsui for just Saturday night. Leave late on Sunday night.
</p>
<p>
Hope everyone is happy and well, Maureen Mike Brenda, Andy and Rob.

Wednesday 24th June - <strong>Hong Kong</strong><br />
<p>
Now in Hong Kong! Dan and Di are in Sorrento (hopefully!). Just so love flying. KLM were good. They are so cheap because every seat is taken. I was in between a 140 Kg massive woman and Mike. She insisted on having her overhead light on the whole time. Asked her if perhaps she could turn it off when sleeping, but she said she had no trouble sleeping with it on! With these old aircraft, the lights go a long way. So, she slumbered away, squashing and blinding me at the same time. Of course, the overhead TVs had rivetting entertainment in Dutch with Chinese subtitles, so I can't complain about boredom. Found a puzzle book (in Italian), at Rome airport and tried to both do the puzzles (like Sodoku), and figure out the instructions in Italian. 
</p>
<p>
Long queue at customs. Andy and Rob were getting anxious waiting for us. So I sent them a reassuring text saying that we had been arrested for having a temperature. Retracted it in another text a minute later. Got to keep the kids on their toes.

<p>
Rob is on the couch in Andy's little apartment. We are staying in the only hotel near Andy (and only around 200 metres away).  It is a brand new <a href="http://www.noahsark.com.hk/eng/noahshotel.php">YMCA place with a "Noah's Ark" theme</a>. It only opened a week ago and we are possibly their first ever Western guests. They really don't know what they are doing there. Had to look around for a receipt book, no credit cards. Each time we want to get in or out, it takes several phone calls, and a small contingent of security guards to open massive security doors. We are the only Westerners and they seem intrigued that we are from Australia. They plan their target to be Chinese group tours, so we are out of their league.
</p>
<p>
It is great to see Andy and Brenda, who are looking fantastic. Always very physically active, they have been on a health kick and are both so lean. (and Brenda was great to start with!). Rob is enjoying his stay very much. We went out to dinner last night, and ate a traditional banquet. So expensive. A treat from Andy, which was very generous.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Off to do a bit of sightseeing, and then see if we can break back into Noah's Ark!
</p>
<p>
Love, Maureen and Mike.

Sunday 21st June - <strong>Rome</strong>
</p>
<p>
Last day in Rome. Fly out tomorrow afternoon. Di and Dan are going to spend 2days in Sorrento/Naples, and then fly home on Thursday from Rome. Mike and I are spending 5 nights in Hong Kong with Brenda and Andy and their 1 million house guests and fly home through Sydney very late Sunday night, arriving lunch time Monday, and back to work, full of zest at the crack of dawn on Tuesday!

<br /><small>... followed by how many priests?</small></div>

<p>
Today, Mike and I went to St Peter�s for 10.30 am Mass- in Latin. Brought back some memories from early childhood, as the Mass was in Latin up until we were in mid primary school. Had it drummed into us by the nuns, and it�s amazing how familiar it all sounded. Mike had previously attended Mass at St Peter�s on the day he flew back to Australia to attend his father�s funeral in 2002.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
There was a translation in the booklet we were given into Spanish, Italian and English. Various people participated in readings etc., speaking in German, Spanish, English, Italian, French, and other languages. The choir was magnificent, and it was the full 100 bishops, priests etc., deal. Full smells and bells. Peter Mills would appreciate that I am finally doing real Catholic stuff.

<p>
Afterwards there were broadcasts, in St Peter�s Square, of Pope Benny doing another Mass i, all on big screens. The Vatican is very techno savvy these days.  We had good seats, arriving a little early, but there would have been about a billion Catholics there, give or take a few, plus the odd Muslim in a headscarf, Proddie etc., for good measure.  A good time was had by all.  It was quite magnificent.
</p>
<p>
However, Benny did not show for his weekly PR gig. Away on holidays perhaps?
</p>
</div>


<p>
For the first time, Di and Dan did their own thing and so did we.
</p>
<p>
So the two of us spent the afternoon at ...
</p>
<p>
1. A Cappucine Monastery where they bury their dead monks, then exhume the bones, and use them to decorate the walls, ceilings etc., and even make lightshades out of them. In the last room a plaque reads:<br />
<em>�What you are now we used to be; what we are now you will be.�</em><br />
Positive stuff!!

2. Bocca della Verita � where the most famous scene of �Roman Holiday� was shot. (Translated: Mouth of Truth) The legend is that if you put your right hand in the mouth of this mask-shaped disc while telling a lie, the mouth will snap shut and bite your hand off.  Obviously, I put my left hand in, and Mike his right hand.

<p>
3. We rounded up the day by visiting the Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano. This was the first Christian basilica built in Rome. This the Pope�s home church, as he is the bishop of Rome. However, the naughty church nicked the huge bronze doors from the Roman forum. There are 15 absolutely enormous statues inside, including the 12 apostles. They certainly give a message of power and authority.

We have had a very busy, but fantastic time in Italy, with delightful travelling companions. Now, we are really looking forward to meeting up with Robbie and Andy in Hong Kong. (Suffer, Pete!)

<p>
Today, was the big one to tour ancient Rome.  ie Nero and his gang! Started off delighted that they predicted a 28 degree day with showers. Sure beats 37 degrees and totally sunny. In the end, the weather amounted to 2 spits of rain, which was even better, as all of the sights of Ancient Rome are pretty much outdoors. Di was prepared as all good nurses always are. She was a bit miffed when I pointed out that her �Valtrex� umbrella, donated by a drug rep, was actually advertising a drug for genital herpes. However, it should be noted that Mike and I have previously done the �Viagra� tour of Jordan, so a precedent had been set. 
</p>
<p>
Started at the Colosseum. Only saw the outside last time. Very impressive. Just love the thought of all those sacrifices. We are now really into people being skinned alive(ie the Apostle Bartholomew), and being grilled (St Lawrence.). St Pete got a relatively good deal, being crucified upside down.
</p>
<p>
Seem to be plenty of American tourists, despite them not having Kevin Rudd to keep them out of recession (That comment is for Steve!).

<p>
After losing our way, and only taking ten thousand or so wrong steps, we toured the Palatine Hill and Roman forum. They sure knew how to build bathhouses in those days! Did another 10.000 steps (uphill), which annoyed Di�s huge blister on her foot just a little.

This evening, again did the Carole Hood thing. Went to her suggested restaurant (<a href="http://www.restaurantsomh.com/r21.htm">Ciampini</a>), at the top of the Spanish Steps. Had to come the heavy with them to remove us from a couple of people smoking very strong cigarettes into our faces. Seriously thought about doing the histrionic patient thing and gasping for breath while clutching my chest and falling to the ground convulsing. Decided to just threaten that I might need an ambulance. After that, it was excellent. They moved us, and the food and service were wonderful. 
</p>
<p>
Can�t believe how quickly time has flown. We all leave Rome on Monday.

Friday 19th June - <strong>Rome</strong>
</p>

<p>
Have now done lots of Catholic stuff. One problem. Picture after picture of St Peter. No problem with that. Our only issue is that every picture shows him with a different set of keys to the Kingdom of Heaven. Do they keep changing the locks????
</p>
<p>
Went on our guided tour of the Vatican Museums. A whirlwind. Very good. Covered in 2 hours what would have taken us 5 hours. Some air conditioned. It is still very hot. SistineChapel not as noisy as last time. No Japanese. Now we are all frescoed out.
</p>
<p>
Went to a cafe where we were not ripped off. However, after our previous cafe experience, treated the waitress as if she was the next Judas. Then on to the Metro and walking through the Villa Borghese. Nice gardens. Quite peaceful, compared to the rest of Rome.
</p>
<p>
Di and I bought identical long shorts for 10 Euros. Don�t care about how we look. Just want to feel cool. They say it might rain eventually tomorrow and cool down.
</p>
<p>
Mike took the garbage out tonight. This is his domestic chore at home. Disaster struck. We have had a painter revamping the front door of the apartment block. Much slower than Michaelangelo. I call him that. �Buona Sera, Michaelangelo! Buongourno,Michaelangelo!� etc.  I say as we leave the building. Turns out he has stuck up the locks. Had a hell of a job getting Mike back in the building. Luckily, during the daytime, we had spotted where several very friendly, homeless people bunked out.  Mike had the option of asking them for hospitality. What a shame, we managed to rescue him.
</p>
<p>
Love to all, Dan, Di, Mike, Maureen.
</p>

<br />
Tuesday 16th (<strong>Vinci</strong>), Wednesday 17th (<strong>Montepulciano, Orvieto</strong>) and Thursday 18th June (<strong>Rome</strong>)<br />
<p>
We hear that Robbie has finally made it to Hong Kong. Received a text message from Andy, asking us to pick up some Clinique at Duty free in Hong Kong for Brenda. He thinks it is the �white stuff� she is after. That narrows it down. 
</p>
<p>
On Tuesday, we had a slack day, Went into Vinci village, and walked around, including the castle, tower, and museum of Leondardo da Vinci.  Bright chap! Found a cool place to enjoy a soft drink, with a breeze � thought 3 Euros was bad. Very hot. 
</p>
<p>
Wednesday, we said goodbye to our postcard-perfect Tuscan villa and headed for Rome. On the way, pulled in to Montepulciano. If not the cutest, it is close to the cutest hill town we have seen. Walked up and up the hill. This time more shade and not as steep as Cortona. The weather continues to be 37&deg;C, with not a cloud in the sky. More churches. Lovely gelati. Lovely squares and buildings. 360 degree views of Tuscany and Umbria.
</p>
<p>
Then on to Orvieto. Very much a hill top town. Up a precipice. Funicular out of service. Caught the local bus up to the Duomo. Bus was packed with Poms on a big group tour, all of whom, of course, have married children and grandchildren in Australia. Don�t they all?
</p>
<p>
Church similar to Siena. Striped marble, georgeous mosaics. Immaculate. Works by Giotti and all the big names. C-oooo-l inside! Becoming immune to exquisite.
</p>
<p>
Everywhere we have gone, wildflowers are spectacular. Especially wild poppies. My lasting memory of Italy will be the intoxicating perfumes of all the flowers- especially roses, lavender and jasmine. 
</p>
<p>
We soldiered on to the hair-raising drive into Rome. Actually found a parking space in the shade just around the corner from our apartment!  Not actually a legal parking space, but you can�t have everything. Mike minded the car and the rest of us toted up the gear. Very happy with the apartment. Air conditioned!! Well appointed. 10 minute walk to St Peter�s. 
</p>
<p>
Mike and I took the car back to Hertz, arguing with them about the non functioning fuel gauge, dints etc., and eventually beating the man into submission.  Walked back to our apartment �only around 4 km, but so hot! Saw another lady with exactly the same sandals as me- and I thought they were totally unique to that Noosa shop in Hastings St! She thought hers were totally unique to some place in Dallas, Texas. We both have a lattice suntan pattern on our feet, and we both read the small print and were then happy the Chinese economy is doing so well in the shoe sales dept!
</p>
<p>
St Peter�s Square is just spell binding. Bernini knew a thing or two. Went to a local cafe, and had a salad and calamari. They had obviously planned ahead and put the dressing on the salad at 7am for 8pm dinner. It was shocking. So was the bill.
</p>

<p>
Thursday, we had pre-booked a tour of the archaeological diggings under St Peter�s, thanks to a tip from our friend, Carole Hood. We were so lucky. Only 300 people a day have this privilege, in groups of 12-14. Many thousands of people visit St Peter�s every day. Our guide was incredibly knowledgeable and well balanced in her presentation. It was totally captivating. St Peter�s is basically on about 6 different levels, above where the bones of St Peter were found.  Our heads were spinning, continually visualising the 3 D picture of where we were in place and history. It was quite difficult to get one�s bearings at times, despite the guide�s immense knowledge and help.
</p>
<p>
The whole tour took nearly 2 hours. We had two American families with lovely teenage children, a Catholic priest from Ireland and his two elderly sisters. The priest was delightful, and ended the tour with a nice prayer. Another stroke of luck was ending up in the Basilica of St Peter�s, as we know it today, rather than queuing up outside in the heat. I had forgotten how breathtaking St Peter�s is. I think the tour of the archaeological site made it much more interesting.

<p id="barmoretto">
<strong>Bar Moretto</strong> We went to a nearby ordinary sort of cafe, and made one big mistake. Did not get a quote for our sandwiches and soft drinks. Desperate to sit down, we had forgotten about the tourist sharks. How about 6 Euros for a soft drink and 49 Euros for 2 people for sandwiches and soft drinks!!! Once bitten, twice shy. We have now been to the supermarket and bought our own groceries again. 
</p>
</div>

<p>
Ran out of time to see the Vatican Museums. Went along there and tried to buy a ticket for the next day. No go. Decided we would like a guided tour. Can only be booked on the internet. Expressed our disappointment, and the man who was informing us of the rules turned out to be the PR guy. He broke the �internet only� booking rule for us, and we now have a booking for tomorrow and do not have the queue! Will definitely pray for the poor souls in the 2 hour queue in the 37 degree heat.
</p>
<p>
Now, have just returned from an evening visit to the Trevi fountain, a walk past many piazzas (and wait for it...churches), on to the magnificent Pantheon, and Piazza Navona. Had forgotten the magnificence of the Trevi. Last time it was quite late at night. This time still quite light. A much cooler evening- ie not completely dripping perspiration hot, with big crowds of people out and about. All lovely.  Had dinner at a very cheerful and inexpensive little restaurant. Walked back to the Metro via the Spanish Steps.
</p>
<p>
The light switch timer in the loo at the restaurant was very economical. Cut out on Di within about... let�s say ... 10 seconds. Italian loos just love Di.
</p>
<p>
Hope all is well at home. Dan has just managed to find BBC Prime on the TV, but I haven�t watched it, as I have coped without news for 19 days. (Did hear that Hillary fell over in the White House and broke her arm!)

Sunday 14th (<strong>Vinci</strong>) and Monday 15th June (<strong>Cortona and Assisi</strong>)</p>

<p>
As the road past our villa is closed for the race, we enjoyed our first day off. Very hot. Around 36 degrees. Our villa is cool, but does not have air conditioning as promised in the ad! We think the flat above us does. However, we are the only ones here.

Walking down our front paddock, through the olive trees, we were at the finish line of the car race. As if our mountain road is not curly enough! They added  extra obstacles. Only one ambulance job. Talk about colourful and noisy. It all ended with fireworks at midnight.
</p>
<p>
Still have not been able to find the internet. Asked someone in town, and they suggested the local library! We are still connecting by phone to Pete and he is putting news on the internet.
</p>
<p>
Most Italians seem more lifestyle focused than we are. Even in the most touristy areas, many shops close between 1 and 4pm. They might open at 9 or 10, and finish at 7.30. Then they complain that they are really suffering in the recession!

<p>
Monday, we had a big day. Rated, possibly the best. Went to Cortona, a hill town. Very cutesy. Walked up and up, then up and up, and more up and up, to the top of the hill for fantastic views. Of course, at the top you found a descent sized church, monastery etc., Saw other churches, medieval streets etc., Had lunch in the main square sampling local cuisine and wine (our first real restaurant meal). We are becoming addicted to gelati. Especially when it is 37 degrees, and you have to wear clothes below the knee and with sleeves, to enter a church.  Not to mention when you spend all day doing step classes!

<br /><small>Assisi</small></div>

<p>
Decided to drive on further, past the glorious Lake Transimeno, and Perugia, into Umbria and to Assisi. Last time Mike and I travelled there, they were still recovering from an earthquake. They have painstakingly restored the 800 year old Giotti frescoes, crumb by crumb! Assisi has such a lovely outlook, and is the real deal religious stuff, with lots of Franciscan monks and devout Christians. A funeral was underway. Expected lots of Italian emotional outpouring of grief. The poor bugger must have been 100 and demented or simply, not very nice, because everyone looked pretty happy. Di and Dan enjoyed the visit and are coping well with mega Catholic stuff, including the souvenir shops with lots of Catholic bling. Will be awarding Di and honorary degree in Catholic theology at the end o f all this super religious tourism.
</p>
<p>
Dan and Di have settled into the back seat of the car, happy not to have to cope with the moody GPS. Mike says I give too much information (reading the GPS), then not enough, etc. I have never encountered such quiet back seat passengers. Perhaps we simply cannot hear them above our shouting.  Saw a big truck rollover yesterday. This makes a total of 4 serious accidents. (5 including Mike's scrape on the rock wall.) We thought the Spanish drivers and roads were bad.! 
</p>
<p>
Having another day off Tuesday, and then a really big one Wednesday, doing touristy things and then ending up in Rome.

Saturday 13th June - <strong>Pisa, Lucca</strong>
</p>
<p>
Had a brilliant day today. Started off with a horrible traffic jam for an hour, due to roadworks. Di and I became totally fluent in Italian to fill in time.

<br /><small>All the other tourists were trying to hold the tower up.</small></div>

<p>
Went to Pisa. 30�C and clear blue skies. In contrast to bleak and wintery when Di was last in Pisa, and rainy when I was last there. All new to Mike and Dan. The church is simply stunning.  Pisano took 10 years to craft the pulpit alone. Wonderful artwork, and especially the marble. Also modern altar and pulpit which were beautiful. Same for the Baptistry. Lovely luscious green lawns outside. Heaps of souvenir shops, and the usual illegal Somali immigrants trying to tout their wares. Did not go up the leaning tower because we did not pre-book, and it is so expensive, and we were too lazy to climb the stairs.
</p>
<p>
Took a walk through the squares and medieval old city and it was just beautiful. They even had a lady to take the 30 cents for the toilet, so we did not have to stress about coins in slots (Especially, Di!).

<p>
Went on to Lucca. Much nicer than anticipated. Walked around the city wall which was popular with roller bladders, cyclists and people in wheelchairs. It is the only city wall I can remember with lots of shady trees. Lovely streets, squares, and quaint shops. Could not face going into another church.
</p>
<p>
Toured through Pistoia, famous for inventing the pistol. Now famous for manufacturing trains. Mastered another grocery store. It is a real challenge finding a trolley and returning it, let alone deciphering all the labels. 
</p>
<p>
Have stocked up on beer and wine for tomorrow. Our road is closed for the big car race. It is the Italian Championship Slalom car rally. Our tiny village is in the middle of the course, and we are housebound. Plan to watch the petrol heads do crazy things.
</p>
<p>
We will give the Italian drivers full marks for fast reflexes. As far as obeying any traffic signs or road manners they are a dead loss. We are also wondering if it is compulsory to have one arm totally outside the car window.
</p>
<p>
Cannot believe that we have been here 2 weeks. Tuscany is just like in the movies, especially where we are living.

Thursday 11th June - <strong>Florence</strong> and Friday 12th June - <strong>San Gimignano, Sienna</strong>
</p>
<p>
Had a huge day in Firenze (Florence) on Thursday. So lucky that we pre-booked the tickets to the Uffizi and the Accademie over the internet. You can wait up to 7 hours in line! We waltzed past all those poor people, and were inside both galleries in a few minutes. 
</p>
<p>
Started off at Piazzale Michaelangelo- a lookout with stunning views over Florence. The Duomo is still the tallest structure in Florence, even though it was begun in 1296. It is the world�s 4th largest cathedral. The dome and the pink, white and green marble facade are wonderful.  We were running a bit late, and parked (for free- unknown in Italy), at Piazzale Michaelangelo and caught a cab   through the horrid traffic to the Accademie. Only a short journey, but a nightmare drive, and well worth the small cab fare. 
</p>
<p>
The big ticket item at the Accademie is, of course, Michaelangelo�s �David�. Very pretty boy. How times change. Small apparatus was considered desirable.  He is looking pretty good for someone who is 550 years old, especially as he was out in the weather, at the Piazza del Signora for 369 years! However, he has had some beauty treatments � a body scrub with hydrochloric acid in 1843, and a clay and cellulose pulp �mud pack� in 2004. Works for him. Over the centuries, the poor chap has been struck by lightning, attacked by rioters, and had his toes bashed with a hammer. His arm was broken in the 1527 revolt when the Medici were kicked out of Florence. Vasari, a child at the time, picked up the pieces and 16 years later had them restored! There were lots of other great art works. 
</p>
<p>
We walked to the Duomo, and Baptistry, and went through the markets and then had some lunch near the Uffizi.�Lonely Planet� really bags the �Uffizi�. We spent hours there and thought it was fantastic.
</p>
<p>
The Ponte Vecchio was packed with jewellery shops, and was very cute. 
</p>
<p>
We headed over to the Basilica of Santa Croce, where Michaelangelo, Galileo Gallelei, and other top people are buried. 
</p>
<p>
Di and I had been reading novels set in the Medici era, and had learnt about the various buildings and plazas from the novels, so found it fiction come to life!
</p>
<p>
Hailed a cab, up to the lookout, and motored back to our villa near Vinci.   By the way, the weather is 30 degrees, clear skies. Fantastic.
</p>
<p>
There are some mysteries in life. Why do Germans have to walk with (usually 2) walking sticks? Even when not old and infirm?  And why do so many Italians in full racing gear pedal bicycles over hill and dale, looking tortured. There are thousands of them.
</p>
<p>
Today, Friday, we went down to San Gimignano. Frantic carpark. Di was nearly collected by a Ferrari. Driver apologised. I was nearly collected by a Volvo. Not as classy as Di. Very quaint villages. Touristy shops. Went into the Basilica. Fantastic 14th century frescoes.  The 72 towers of San Gimignano were built in the 13th century, and then the town was bypassed on the pilgrim route due to the plague in 1348 � saving it from destruction of the architecture.
</p>
<p>
Went on to Sienna. Not as nice as we had anticipated. The square, described in �Lonely Planet� as the finest in Europe, certainly was not. However, the Cathedral (Duomo) was unbelievable. Itwas completed in 1215. The inlaid marble floor has 56 huge panels depicting biblical and historical scenes. It is spellbinding. There is a side chapel devoted to Pius II with incrediblebooks.The baptistery was similar. 
</p>
<p>
Saw the church devoted to St Catherine. She would definitely be forced to have a 2710 Mental Health Care Plan if she lived in Shailer Park in 2009. We saw the metal whip she tortured herself with, and we saw her tiny preserved thumb! As well as her head! No doubt, being one of 24 siblings did not suit her mental well-being.
</p>
<p>
We have noticed that there are some business logos which would simply not work in Australia. Could you imagine the attraction of �Mucky Milk�? or even the fashion label �Ideal Bimbo�? The Italians speak little English, but have incorporated a number of English words into their every day vocabulary. Maybe, not always successfully!
</p>
<p>
Love to all,
Di, Dan Mike Maureen.

<br /><small>Some cheaters use combination locks. :)</small></div>


<p>
Cloudy morning, fine afternoon. That seems to be the pattern around here. Went to La Spezia to catch the boat up to the five villages of the Cinque Terre. The boat today landed at two of them, and came close to shore for photographs of the other villages, before landing at Monterosso: (choppy seas, meant landing was impossible at the other three.). We had lunch on the waterfront at Vernazza, the second last village. Then caught the train back between the other villages, and walked between <a href="http://getaway.ninemsn.com.au/article.html?id=810909">Manarola and Riomaggiore (just like Catriona Rowntree did on �Getaway�</a>, a couple of months ago). By the way, Jules from �Getaway� is in town, and has been sighted on the train. (OK, Caro, he in no way measures up to George Clooney, but you have to take what you can get!) Di and Dan decided to just train it on this bit, as Di has blisters upon blisters on her feet. There is the lover� seat where you attach a padlock to the rail, and throw the key into the ocean, to show the solidity of your eternal love for your other half. We duly attached a combination lock. (Just kidding!). 
</p>
<p>
The villages are very cutesy, and worth the 20 minute struggle to find the parking lot to catch the boat. Met some nice Germans, (except for the fact that Edgar is a Linux programmer). 
</p>
</div>

<p>
Had a big walk in La Spezia, mostly because we had departed our train one station too early, and then were a little lost. Managed to survive crazy drivers. Now planning Florence tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
Love, Dan, Di, Maureen and Mike

Tuesday, 9th June - <strong>Lezzeno to Vinci</strong><br />
<p>
If you told me that there were one million Italian truck drivers on the road at any one time, I would believe you. I have to say, they are very well behaved truck drivers. However, the density of trucks on the roads certainly beats Spain and France, and leaves us in Aussieland for dead. Mike and Dan do not seem bothered, but Di and I find it a bit overwhelming.
</p>
<p>
We drove from Lezzeno (near Como), and had a stop in Modena. Nice architecture. Unfortunately, the Duomo was closed � both siesta and renovations giving them a reason. Ferrari and Masserati are just out of town. 
</p>
<p>
We are just so polished at Italian. The trouble is, the Italians sometimes really struggle with our Aussie pronunciations. We simply are no good at rolling�r�s�. We were trying to say we liked the �carn� (meat), and they looked horrified. Apparently, we had told them that we had been served �can� (dog). This reaction, from people who eat �Equine� at the butchers!
</p>
<p>
We were just 30 km from our apartment in Vinci, Tuscany, and 1 km from leaving the motorway, when traffic came to a halt. Everyone started to leave their cars. A few metres in front of us, thick smoke filled the air. Ambulance, fire and police arrived. We have never seen a car so burnt out, and so quickly, as the one in the accident. See what I mean about the roads?

<p>
Our new apartment, a Tuscan villa (<a href="http://www.casavacanzeleonardo.com/photo_diary.htm">Agriturismo Leonardo da Vinci</a>) is spectacular. We are totally gob-smacked that one can get such a spacious beautiful apartment with spectacular views of Tuscany, for $35AUS a night per person! The road here was a bit hairy, but totally worth it! Wait till you see the photos!
</p>
<p>
We went to the nearby town, Lamporecchio, (4 km away), to stock up with groceries. Mike slept in the car, and the rest of us did supermarket horror. He had just done road horror. You have to read and translate every label. Quite an exercise. Dan realized that we had to weigh our fruit and vegies, print a label, and seal the bag. He coped very well but decompensated when trying to translate which of the four varieties of lettuce to price.
</p>
<p>
The carn� (meat), looks dreadful. We know it was the end of the day, but... It is so fatty, it is disgusting. Aussies are spoilt with �pick the tick�. We ended up getting the premium mince and some lean hamburger patties, and chicken breasts. The rest for the week will be vegetarian or frozen seafood. Prices are very good, on the whole.
</p>
<p>
We had dinner in the garden, looking out across the fields of Tuscany. Simply splendid!

<p>
Monday 8th June - <strong>Switzerland</strong></p>
<p>
We are just gobsmacked by the kindness, friendliness and generosity of people we meet. Today, we had planned to drive to Locarno, in Switzerland, and catch the Centrovalli railway to Domodossolo, through the mountains.  
</p>
<p>
Firstly, it rained all day, on and off. Secondly, we were not keen on changing money to Swiss francs. Everywhere takes a credit card... don�t they?  
</p>
<p>
Took the car ferry across Lake Como and travelled to Logarno, seeing another beautiful lake. I was mixing up Logana and Locarno, so knew we would not make the first train, having under calculated the distance, as the latter was 40 minutes further away.  Looking out for a loo, stopped at a cafe outside Locarno and bought the obligatory cappuccino. Disappointed that we did not get our passports stamped at the Swiss border. Lazy buggers! 
</p>
<p>
Asked the Italian waitress where the station was located. She, as per normal Italians, could not understand a word of English, and could barely understand our limited Italian. Pointed to a lady in the cafe. Met Heidi, who spoke English. Later, met her husband, who also spoke English. (They both also spoke French, Italian and German!!) Amazing people. They are a little older than us, and you won�t believe what they did for us in the rain. 
</p>

<br /><small>Heidi, our generous new Swiss friend, with Mike and Di</small></div>


<p>
Firstly, they talked to us in the coffee shop about the general set up with the railway, and told us about parking etc., Heidi then put her  Swiss francs in our parking meter. She called her husband, who joined us. They had travelled previously to Australia, and fondly recalled George, a pet lizard in Brisbane. 
</p>
<p>
In the pouring rain, we followed them to the station. No railway attendant. No credit cards accepted. Heidi put enough of her Swiss francs in the meter to last us 8 hours, but we had no way to buy a ticket for the train. So far, she had spent around $15 Aussie dollars on us. We gave her a little koala. (She already had a collection of koalas, but one more is nice!) 
</p>
<p>
She then gave us an alternative tour suggestion, before leaving us with her Email etc.  Her husband was also delightful. 
</p>
<p>
Experiences like this one are so special, and contrast to bus tours, where, of course, less goes wrong, but one simply never really interacts with the locals. And interacting with the locals is at least half the fun!

<p>
We travelled from Locarno around upper Lake Maggiore, then on to a ferry to Levona, and then to Verese for lunch. 
</p>
<p>

Then, across country to the western side of Lake Como, and had a good perv going past George Clooney�s house at Laglio. Turns out he was in Venice, or he would have signed the autograph for Carolyn Bridges.  Missed him by ... that .. much!
</p>
<p>
Took the ferry back to Bellagio in the pouring rain, and then home in Lezzeno. 
</p>
</div>

<p>
Tomorrow, we travel to Tuscany. Di and I want to hoodwink Mike into taking us down the Eastern arm of Lake Como, because we are nervous wrecks on the road from Lezzeno to Como. 
</p>
<p>
Cannot accuse Di of talking too much. She has laryngitis and can barely speak. Dan and I are still snivelling. Mike is still immune.
</p>
<p>
Love to all, and happy birthday to Brendan, 
</p>
<p>
Di, Dan, Mike, Maureen.

<br />
7th June - Stresa</br>
<p>
Today, we travelled down the other side of the lake (to Lecco), and on to Stresa on Lake Maggiore, supposedly the most romantic Italian Lake. It was lovely, and so was the day.  We caught the ferry to two islands in the lake, Isola Bella and Isola Pescatori.  Very touristy.  Had a nice lunch with great views.
</p>
<p>
We are all nervous wrecks travelling on the road from Como to Bellagio. Even the road on the other side of the lake is horrible.  On a Sunday, there are also hundreds of serious cyclists on the narrow winding roads.  At one point an oncoming driver wanted to take his half of the road out of the middle and the side mirror of the car took a swipe from the rock wall.  This adds to the prang into the rock wall we did at the back of the car, which added to the massive ding in the side, already there when we picked up the fairly new car.  Thank goodness we took out full insurance.  We have seen two accidents already.  Yesterday, two cars collided head on, at enough speed to render them towable.  There are almost no footpaths anywhere, and just enough room for two small cars to pass, clinging to the winding road around the cliffs.  Today, we came across an old lady pedestrian badly injured, having been hit by a car, just before the ambulance arrived. Can�t wait to travel the road twice tomorrow, and once the next day!
</p>
<p>
Our toilet escapades are on the improve.  We were dying to go on entering Stresa, and pulled into a small hotel, which was not officially open.  However, the lady not only let us use the lovely loos for free, but made us very cheap cappuccinos to sip in the garden, watching the glorious lake. We are quite overwhelmed by the friendliness of the Italians. Will Rome be different?
</p>
<p>
I carry my glasses around my neck in a holder. We had a short shower today, and I took the camera from around my neck and put it into my handbag. Soon after, noticed the glasses missing. How convenient it is to go back and look at the digital photos, to see when I was last wearing them? (Dan�s suggestion) Found them in about 1 minute flat!  Another stroke of luck.
</p>
<p>
It has been impossible to get to the internet, with time constraints, and the horror of the roads. Italian roads would cause an outcry in Australia.  Motorways are at 130km/hr, and you get only about three car lengths to merge! 
</p>
<p>
Italians are not very much into the internet.  Our WYD billets have only just got an Email address, so there is no easily available wireless network etc.  If we ever get near the internet, we will try to send photos.
</p>
<p>
Love, Dan, Diane, Mike, Maureen

6th June - <strong>Trento</strong></p>
<p>
Big day.  Went to visit our World Youth Day lads.  Met them in Trento.  Daniele lives 1.5 hrs to the north of Trento, and Rudi about 40 mins to the south. Their girl friends (Silvia and Letizia) spoke very good English, and they had certainly done considerable preparation for our visit. 
</p>
<p>
Trento is over 3 hours from where we are staying. They entertained us for 8 hours � so the day was over 14 hours long, but fantastico!

<p>
Letizia had prepared a whole dissertation in English about the history of Trento.  We started off at a coffee shop, and then proceeded to a museum with extensive Roman ruins under a theatre. This was really well done. Then a walk around the beautiful squares and buildings. On to a traditional lunch where they shouted us a very interesting meal with very Germanic food (plus tiramisu).  Trento is minus 30 in the winter and quite hot in the summer, so their local foods are different to the rest of Italy.

<p>
Rudi and Daniele ran into various friends around town. Apparently we are the first from St Matthew�s Loganholme to visit Trento.  We went to an amazing castle (<a href="http://new.buonconsiglio.it/index.php/en/Visit/Plan">Castello del Buonconsiglio</a>) and saw very unique and interesting medieval art work, and then the Duomo (cathedral).  This definitely showed the influence of the Turks it had a minaret-like tower, and the women had to go upstairs to pray separately from the men, just like in a mosque. We finished off in a cafe, and returned very late to Como. They were all so generous, giving us such hospitality, time and even gifts for us personally, and St Matthews and Beenleigh parishes, as well as a special present from Jim and Carolyn Kanowski's WYD billets.  My tiny bags are overflowing.

Dan and Di were still battling the piglet flu. Mike is still well, and I am snivelling. Dan and Di stayed home to have a quiet day.

Fri 5th June - <strong>Bellagio, Lake Como</strong>
</p>

<br /><small>Cute; the villages on Lake Como are, too.</small></div>

<p>
Had a more relaxing day today. Slightly cloudy, and a little shower this evening. Walked around Bellagio, and then rode the ferries on Lake Como for the rest of the day. Lovely villages. Talk about an overload of churches! Tiny villages had 10 or more of them. What heathen s are the people in Shailer Park! 
</p>
<p>
Had some trout from the Lake for lunch, at a cafe in Colico in the very north of the lake, where the menus were in German and Italian, and the staff seemed very German. Snow on the mountains.
</p>
<p>
Toilets remain a terrifying experience. They are electronic. You put in your coins and wait for a command. Then you enter a metallic box with no contact with the outside world. Your hands are automatically soaped and washed, and the toilet automatically cleans. So claustrophobic. Diane had no luck with coins in slots � AGAIN. Turns out the toilet was still automatically cleaning. We are both now entering 2710 therapy for toilet phobia. 
</p>
<p>
Di and Dan were near some sneezing middle Eastern man in Dubai. Turns out we now all (except Mike), have piglet flu. Sniffly, not feverish, but whinging a bit. Bought the biggest box of tissues available. The people at the market (not supermarket) recoiled in fear when we entered again. Our dramatic demonstrations of sneezing � asking for �tisutus�, leaving them horrified!  All of the staff took two paces backwards when we approached. Bellagio is such a small town. 
</p>
<p>
Dan feels miserable with the piglet flu, and he and Di have decided to just relax at our apartment tomorrow. I texted our Italian friends to tell them that Dan and Di were unwell, and just Mike and I were going to Trento tomorrow. They immediately had one of their English speaking girlfriends phone us in a panic. My Italian is so good � they thought we had all cancelled out!
</p>
<p>
Robbie has his passport application in process. What a drama! Mike backed into a stone wall, despite my warnings that he was too close.  Thank goodness for insurance. In short, all is well in the world.
</p>

<p>
Love to all, Dan, Diane, Mike and Maureen.

Thu 4th June - <strong>Verona</strong>
</p>
<p>
We have landed in paradise. Our apartamento looks out on to Lake Como, which must be one of the best in the world. 
Weather is still perfecto.

<br /><small>Under Romeo &amp; Juliet's balcony, Verona</small></div>

<p>
Earlier, left Venice, hopped on the train to the mainland, and picked up the Hertz hire car. It is quite large, but has a big ding down one side, making shutting the sliding door a Herculean exercise. Six manual gears plus reverse, makes it a challenge to drive initially. We are all letting Mike do that. 
</p>
<p>
Drove to Verona, and saw Romeo and Juliet�s balcony. Also the beautiful view from the tower. Did a general walk around. Definitely the stuff of wonderful postcards. Heard from home that Robbie, who was due to go to Hong Kong today, had just discovered that his passport expired in February. Peter sorted things out. He now does not leave until 17th June, and will be back on 1st July, in time for college. This makes him on holiday in Hong Kong when we are there! How cosy!
</p>
<p>
Di will need a 2710 Health Plan when back in Australia to cope with her new fear of coins in slots. Dan finds the foot spas are great for washing hair. 
</p>
<p>
Still surprised how little English people have in tourist areas. I am now good at charades. People are very helpful, however.
</p>
<p>
The road from Como to Lezzeno (and then Bellagio) is simply terrifying. Mike is exhausted. They hurl around the hairpin bends all over the tiny road, at great speed. We had to back up, at one point, it was so narrow.
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow, we are going to Bellagio again. Only 6km, but scary. Seeing the cutesy streets, and then catching ferries around the lake.

<p>
Wednesday June 3 - <strong>Venice Day 2</strong>
</p>
<p>
We are so, so exhausted.  Have retreated back to our beautiful apartment to drink wine on the balcony. 
</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mikefitzsimon/3726305172/" title="Di &amp; Dan blending in with Piazza San Marco by MikeFitz, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2487/3726305172_6aed997f43_t.jpg" width="100" height="75" alt="Di &amp; Dan blending in with Piazza San Marco" /></a>
<br /><small>Di &amp; Dan blending in with Piazza San Marco</small></div>

<p>
Did a stroll through to St Mark�s square, admiring the shops.  All of us except Dan have been to Venice  on a tour before. Talk about see almost nothing on these coach tours. We had no idea there was so much to see. 
</p>
<p>
It seems we cannot stay out of trouble for long. Went to the loo. Should be a simple exercise?  Di put  her 1.5 Euros in the slot. No obvious sign to say you cannot put in 20c pieces.  Machine jammed.  Di went to second machine.  More money.  No luck in having turnstile open.  Toilet attendant went ballistic! There she was screaming and shouting and then she grabbed a knife and started to wave it menacingly.  Put in another 1.5 Euros and Di could enter. Lady still screaming and shouting.  Stabbing knife down machine slot in frenzied manner.  We were pretty unhappy too.  Talk about an expensive trip to the toilet.  Had momentarily considered just using the floor, then she would have had something to scream about. Woman from Melbourne chimed in to support us. Now too afraid to go back to that loo.
</p>
<p>
Went to the post office.   Big queue.   Aussies in front of us had packed nice Italian clothes in an Italiano Post cardboard box, purchased at the post office, to send home.  Of course, at the Hyperdome, this would be taped up nicely by the Aussie Post staff. Italian Postal worker refused to accept article.Not taped up. No tape available. Aussie man turned around and asked huge queue in a loud voice if anyone had any tape. No takers. Aussies very polite actually. Had to go and buy tape, and go to end of long queue. This time it was not Di and I in trouble.
</p>

<br /><small>As we admired the tiled exterior of the Doge's Palace, this bloody great cruise ship glided by with HOW MANY people on the upper deck?</small></div>

<p>
Paid 13 Euros to see Doges palace. Mainly so there would be a new loo attendant. Turns out the palace was magnificent way beyond our expectations. Went to loo at Doges. All queued up, and attendant indicated to Dan that he was next. Ever the gentleman, Dan tried to let we ladies go first. Trouble was, there was a definite �Gents� sign on the door. Dan keep deferring to the ladies. Attendant kept somewhat shouting �Signor�. He kept insisting on ladies first, until everyone was shouting �Dan � it�s a Signor�, toilet!� We are not good at toilets.
</p>
<p>
Then the Basilica. Gold mosaics dating back 900 years. St Mark�s body in a coffin under the altar. (This time, not a glass coffin). There was a work of art with 2000 precious stones in it! Unbelievable. The floor undulated, due to good old Venice sinking.
</p>
<p>
Caught the Vaporetto up to near San Polo.  Wandered around the cutest streets.  Venice must have about 100 churches per square km. Minimum. All bigger than Brisbane�s cathedral. We are amazed at the variety of styles in architecture and decor. 
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow we pick up the hire car. Goodness knows what new dramas will unfold.  (Still haven�t paid the speeding ticket from last year�s Spain trip. The Spanish Ministerio del Interior didn't buy Mike assertion that Justice Marcus Einfeld was driving.)

Ciao, Maureen Mike Di and Dan.

<br /><small>Mike on the canal where we stayed</small></div>

<p>
The apartment (<a href="http://www.adashouseinvenice.com/index_e.php">Ada's House in Venice</a>) where we are staying is magnificent. We actually have the top level of the building to ourselves, on a little canal just off the Grand Canal. Napoleon stayed opposite once, and the gondolas glide by outside our bedroom windows. There is a wonderful big patio, with all sorts of colourful flowers spilling all over and around it. The owners, Ada and Roberto, spoke little English, but were full of enthusiasm and so welcoming. It is amazing how far you can get with basic Italian, sign language, and a map!
</p>
<p>
Went on the number one Vaporetto around the Grand Canal. Just glorious. Even saw a submarine, and an Aussie flag on a building. The old palaces are wonderful, and all the windows had windowboxes overflowing with flowers. Went up the tower in St Mark�s square- fantastic views. Had a beer in a place on the square � standing. It would have cost twice as much for sitting down. We did some shopping for friends, and then went back on the vaporetto to our lovely apartment.
</p>
<p>
Dinner at a cheap and cheerful cafe, and a perfect day was over!
</p>
<p>
PS. Di and I will be writing a book on 1001 uses for a foot spa (bidet)!

<p>
Monday 1st June - <strong>Milan</strong>
</p>
<p>
We are settling in well to Italy. Dan has not travelled much, and has had a few adjustments. In Dubai, he went looking for the loo. Saw a door where lots of men were entering a room. No sign on the door,except for some intriguing symbol looking like a middle eastern house. On entering, he could not believe how unsafe a loo could be. Shoes were everywhere.So unsafe. Anyone could just trip over them all. It was so big, and he went wandering around, looking for the trough. After much shouting, he was evicted . Fortunately, he had not relieved himself,  and no charges were laid. He now knows about prayer rooms. 
</p>
<p>
Then, in Milan, he had such sore feet. Could not believe that the hotel room had a foot spa.   More education. Dan now knows all about the usual uses of bidets.
</p>
<p>
Mike, as usual, is an expert on everything, and in control of everything. With puffed out chest, he announced to us all how lucky we were to have such an intelligent fellow traveller who managed to find one particular destination (Beck deli). We then photographed him outside a store called �Upim�. Karma. 
</p>
<p>
Di and I have heard that the penalty for murdering husbands in Italy is three �Hail Mary�s�. Sounds like a good deal, and might take them up on it. 
</p>
<p>
Our hotel is just wonderful. Everyone so friendly, relaxed. Nothing a trouble. So central. Hotel Berna is fantastic value in every way. 
</p>
<p>
Maximilliano, or just Max, our bar man (yes � we now do have a personal one, who had the cheek to comment on how much the girls in Aussieland drink compared to the boys!), recommended our sightseeing today.  Over 9 hours of walking later, we blame him for our very sore feet. ...and our need for more of his medicine. What a fantastic day. Twenty five degrees, light breeze.

<br /><small>Galleria Vittorio Emmanele: The girls' eyes lit up</small></div>


<p>
We spent ages at the Duomo (Cathedral). Forgot to tell Di to do step classes, as well as lots of walking in preparation for the holiday. Never mind, she is certainly doing step classes now. The cathedral is huge, and can seat 40,000 people. Just as high as wide. Saw beautiful treasures, and a bishop in a glass coffin! Ugh! 
</p>
<p>
Then on to the Galleria Vittoria Emanuele II In other words, a shopping centre, that is absolutely exquisite.  The tiles on the floor alone, are just to die for. Kay would just love the Louis Vuitton store. And there were people walking tiny dogs just to add to the whole feel.

<p>
We went walking in the area of designer shops. Stick thin, well heeled chics were looking nonchalant and swanning by. When a bloke in the most amazing Lamborghini pulled up beside us, the local girls ignored him, and Di and I gasped and fell at his feet! Pity, the girl beside him looked so smug.. We only just resisted lying down in the road in front of the car. He obviously loved us, as he roared off with a great show of testosterone. Aagh, Italy!
</p>
<p>
Saw the longest shopping street in the world and bought NOTHING! Worse than three �Hail Mary�s� a hundred times over. We have to travel light. :( 
</p>
<p>
Saw Roman ruins, and churches built on pagan Roman temples. The La Scala Opera Theatre was a classic, and we were sure we had seen it many times in the movies. Audrey Hepburn?

<br /><small>No, seriously, here's another.</small></div>

<p>
Have found that not many Italians speak English. Ran into a group of Belgians who were complaining bitterly about this fact. In their country, they speak French, English and German. They could not understand the �ignorance� of the Italians!  You do worry about the image of Aussies abroad though don�t you? Not just our lack of language skills, but, when a 35 year old Belgian who speaks excellent English, asks you if there are any museums in Australia, I could only respond in the affirmative, with a side comment that we also live in houses, not tents!
</p>
<p>
Our Italian is improving hugely. In France and Spain, we found lots of people spoke English. Not here. At least, not where we mix. When we were last in Italy, we were on a bus tour and did not mix with the locals. That is one of the big problems with bus tours. Now, we spend large amounts of the day talking with them. Thank goodness, Di and I have spent a lot of time trying to learn Italian. We are really using it.
We did the cheapo thing again tonight, eating the free food in the bar and paid for the bubbly. Great deal. For dessert, we  the world�s most wonderful little tarts, from a deli called �Peck�. Better than Harrods. Each little tart is packed in a box with a ribbon. Wow! 
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow morning, we leave lovely Milan and travel by train to Venice. <br />
Arrevederci. Maureen.

<br /><small>KLM across the Alps</small></div>


<p>
Arrived In Milan. Had the most fantastic flight (with KLM) from Amsterdam to Milan. Clear blue skies all the way. Holland was just wonderful, with little moats around each green field, and water everywhere. They must be forgetting to put their fingers in the dykes. 
Then on to the Italian/Swiss Alps, covered in snow, with green valleys and fast running streams due to the melting snow. The big lakes of Northern Italy � like Maggiore and Como, were just stunning from the lowish altitude of the plane. Lots of vacant seats on the flight, and the plane was standard fare, not an archaeological resurrection. 
</p>
<p>
Pottered around for a short while till Diane and Dan arrived. Mike had a good sleep. Then trotted off to the Santa Maria delle Gracie to see Leonardo�s famous fresco of the last supper. Although it is said to have lost 80% of its colour, and some past renovator was fairly brutal and chopped off Jesus� feet (which were crossed under the table), it is quite a masterpiece (of course)! Then back to the hotel. 
</p>
</div>

<p>
The custom in Milan is to provide tapas when customers buy a drink in the evening. We shared an exquisite bottle of bubbly for 25 Euros between the four of us, and had a nice dinner for free at our hotel with the bubbly.  Not bad. 
</p>
<p>
Our hotel (<a href="http://www.hotelberna.com/EN/">Hotel Berna</a>) is wonderful. Such great value for money � 75 Euros double, and rooms are great, position is fantastic, staff are brilliant, and there is free tea, coffee, soft drink, juice, bottled water and even cake!
</p>
<p>
People everywhere have been so friendly and helpful. What a great start!
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow, we will �do� Milan, using all of the barman�s suggestions for a great day. 
</p>
<p>
Ciao, Maureen.

Sunday 31st May
</p>
<p>
In Amsterdam, waiting for the flight to Milan. Felt like royalty on the Qantas flight to Hong Kong. 2 seats each! No wonder Qantas shares are down the gurgler. After 5 hours in Honkers airport boarded KLM to Amsterdam. No free seats there. So nice of the Dutch to bring out a museum piece aircraft just for us. The food was similarly impressive. The only thing Mike has lost so far are the icons on his screen. The wallet in his backpocket is amazingly still there after 28 hours of holiday. Lovely day here. Like winter in Brissie. buongiurno, Maureen.
