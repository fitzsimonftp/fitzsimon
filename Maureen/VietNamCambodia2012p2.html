<h3>Phu Quoc -&gt; Ho Chi Minh -&gt; Phnom Penh</h3>
<p>Off to Cambodia...</p>

<small>Itinerary for Weeks 3 and 4.</small>
</div>

<p>Had a nice breakfast with the girls, and then took the shuttle to the airport.&nbsp; Just me.</p>

<p>Vietnam Airlines again left on time, and Phu Quoc and southern Vietnam looked lovely from the air.</p>

<p>Mike arrived from Kuala Lumpur at SGN airport 90 minutes before me, and we met up outside the domestic terminal.&nbsp; A taxi trip into town to pick up my big bag from a prior hotel, took us past some of the city landmarks.&nbsp; Then straight back to the airport for another on time flight to Phnom Penh.</p>

<p>After a bit of fussing arranging the Cambodian visa and local currency, we were met by our guide, Kheang, who has spectacular English.&nbsp; Apparently, 30 years ago, a friend of his was taking English lessons.&nbsp; Liking the sound of English, he rode his bicycle 20 km each way for lessons.&nbsp; This has led to many types of jobs over the years, which have polished his skills to a high level.&nbsp; On the way into town, he gave us a good commentary about Cambodia -politics, history, demographics, geography, and the like.</p>

<p>Our hotel is interesting.&nbsp; We seem to have a room in a renovated old house in a back street.&nbsp; It is old, but large and comfortable.</p>

<p>The heat is oppressive.&nbsp; The humidity unbelievable.&nbsp; 26�C min.&nbsp; 37�C max.</p>

<p>Had a lovely dinner close to the hotel.&nbsp; Nearly everything is charged in USD.&nbsp; Seems a little more expensive than Vietnam, but also better.</p>

<p>The roads seem better also, and there are more cars and fewer motor bikes.&nbsp; It is amazing that Cambodia has risen so much from the ashes of Pol Pot in 33 years.&nbsp; Nothing was left, when his reign ended, having killed 2 million people out of 7 million.&nbsp; Makes Hitler almost sound reasonable! ....Maybe, not!</p>

<p>Cheers, Maureen.</p>

<h3>Phnom Penh</h3>
</div>

<div class="article">
<p>After a delicious breakfast, we headed off with Kheang and our Driver, Mr Mab, in our air conditioned, but still hot, Camry.&nbsp; Firstly, the palace.&nbsp; Magnificent.&nbsp;  It was built in 1866 by King Norodom at the junction of the Tonle Sap River and the Mekong, facing East, as is traditional.</p>
</div>

<div class="article">
	<div class="thumb" style="width:340px; height:265px">
	<img src="./images/2012Indochina/PhnomPenhPalace.jpg" width="320" height="240" alt="PhnomPenhPalace" /><br />
	<small>In the grounds of Phnom Penh Palace</small>
	</div>
<p>Thank goodness, Pol Pot had the King under house arrest, and didn't wreck that, too!&nbsp;  One room, a Buddhist shrine (the Silver pagoda), had over 5000 solid silver floor tiles.&nbsp;  And a Buddha was made of 90 kg of gold, and others were studded with diamonds and precious stones.&nbsp; I'm talking 9584 diamonds on one Budda alone!&nbsp; Particularly striking, was the Emerald Buddha, made out of translucent jade.&nbsp;  Sort of Buddhism�s answer to the Vatican Museums!</p>

<p>The palace is actually a large site with numerous buildings, including a throne room, a Moonlight Pavilion, and the Royal Residence.&nbsp; Hundreds of metres of murals would once have been magnificent.&nbsp; This is the only part of the complex which needs renovation.&nbsp; Everything else is perfect, including the gardens.</p>

<p>Things went downhill after the palace.&nbsp; We went to visit the "Killing Fields" of Pol Pot.&nbsp; Not fun.&nbsp; It was Mourning Day in Cambodia, so the positive thing was that there was a big Buddhist prayer service in a marquee on the Camp Choeng Ek, where 86 mass graves have been unearthed.</p>

<p>Our guide was 12 years old when this all began, and was working the fields outside Phnom Penh.&nbsp; At the end of the Vietnam War, when the US heavily bombed Cambodia, many children were orphaned.&nbsp; These children were recruited and brainwashed by Pol Pot and became the "enforcers" of his murderous regime.</p>

<p>A school was turned into a prison, the S21, and is now the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum.&nbsp; More gruesome stuff on display, initiated by the evil, psychopathic Pol Pot.&nbsp; An Australian journalist was among the 2 million tortured shockingly, and killed.&nbsp; In the school grounds we met one of the two living survivors of S21.</p>

<p>Then on to Phnom Penh Museum.&nbsp; Thankfully, Pol Pot closed it and left many priceless antiques and sculptures untouched.&nbsp; He destroyed plenty as well!&nbsp;  Buddhist and Hindu sculptures and artefacts dating back to the 2nd century were on view.&nbsp; Interesting to note that the elaborate roof was repaired by the Australian Government and and several Australian corporate donors in 1994.</p>
</div>

	<small>Bamboo Naga being prepared for Khmer New Year in the park below Wat Phnom</small>
	</div>
<p>Finally, we went to the Wat Phnom Temple, Phnom Penh's namesake.&nbsp; It was very, very hot and humid climbing the stairs and I felt quite faint.</p>

<p>As we drove around we talked to Kheang about life in Cambodia.&nbsp; (And it is "Cambodia", not "Kampuchea". That name was used by Pol Pot and is ofen still used by some Vietnamese, but locals definitely use "Cambodia".)&nbsp; The average wage in Cambodia is $10 a week.&nbsp; Pocket money for little kids in Australia.&nbsp; School is free, when you are lucky enough to have one nearby.&nbsp; Hospitals are also free, if you want to wait as long as you do at Logan Hospital.&nbsp; Our guide thought that all doctors were killed by Pol Pot, but I heard that 4 lived.&nbsp; The government is attempting to immunize all children and this has improved child health considerably.</p>

<p>There is a Constitutional Monarchy, with elections every 5 years.&nbsp; The son of the King is 59 years old and never married, and has no known children, so the future could be different.</p>

<p>Saw the Aussie Embassy, next to the Parliament.&nbsp; What a horrible building!&nbsp; We hear that it is difficult to obtain even a tourist visa to Australia, and so to implement that policy, they begin by really turning people off, just by the look of the Embassy.</p>


<p>Back to the hotel, and straight to the shady pool, I went.&nbsp;  Heaven.</p>

<p>Had a rest and then, in the evening, went for a big walk.&nbsp; Crossing the road is much more difficult than in Vietnam.&nbsp; Since rebuilding the roads after Pol Pot, many are 5 lanes each way, and the traffic moves faster, due to the larger number of cars.&nbsp; At least the ped crossings are better lit, even if still mostly ignored.</p>

<p>We walked in the heavy, hot evening air along two boulevards, which were beautiful.&nbsp; Several dance groups were practising on the polished granite surfaces, just like they do in China.</p>

<p>Past the Palace, and on to the waterfront, we trotted, and found "My Home Restaurant", as recommended on TripAdvisor.&nbsp; Delicious!&nbsp; Cheap!&nbsp; Something about the way I slowly, and as clearly as I can, ask for a glass of WHITE wine, seems to translate as RED wine.&nbsp; This has happened a couple of times now.&nbsp; Never mind.&nbsp; $20 for two of us for the lot; including lots of water!</p>

<p>Having lost courage to cross the road, we took a Tuk Tuk back to the hotel.&nbsp; Quite comfortable, but the motor bike towing us, had no headlights.&nbsp; Glad I wore white slacks and Mike wore his white shirt.</p>

<p>Cheers, Maureen</p>

<h3>Phnom Penh -&gt; bus to Siem Reap</h3>

<p>This morning, we were taken to the bus station by Kheang and the driver and said goodbye.</p>
</div>

	</div>
<p>Now, if you have to travel from Phnom Penh to Siem Riep in the dry season, and so cannot go by boat up the Mekong, I highly recommend you fly.&nbsp; Having done the 7 hour trip on the bus, I recommend you don't.&nbsp; The country is dead flat, and most houses are high on stumps, no doubt, due to big floods.</p>

<p>The bus stops after 3.5 hours at Kampong Thom, for 30 minutes.&nbsp; It takes 25 minutes to receive your meal, so it was a good thing that it was salty and inedible.</p>

<p>I staggered off the bus, having occupied 1/2 seat squashed against a window, while tiny Mike took up 1.5 seats beside me.</p>

<p>Our guide, Khom, and driver, Dee, greeted us in the wilderness which passed for a bus station.&nbsp; We are in the equivalent of the Darwin "build up".&nbsp; Very hot temperatures, sky high humidity, and no rain.&nbsp; Apparently, the worst weather in the year!</p>

	</div>
<p>We dropped luggage at our hotel, the Somavedi, and headed to the massive Ankor Wat site, one of 296 temples.&nbsp; 2 million people a year do likewise.&nbsp; We took a few classic shots, and then returned to the hotel for a lovely dinner.</p>

<p>Stopped via the Pharmacy, as my left ear has been blocked since swimming in the last hotel pool.&nbsp; Can you believe $14.50 for Waxsol?&nbsp; Hope this will fix the deafness!</p>

<p>Cheers, Maureen.</p>

<h3>Siem Reap</h3>

<p>Today has not been so much a day touring, as an endurance test.&nbsp; It is blisteringly hot.&nbsp; High 30s with unimaginable suffocating humidity; just the weather to do a 6 hour step class in the blinding sun.&nbsp; I have to confess I haven�t felt great since my virus which started in Hue.&nbsp; Today was no cure!&nbsp; It is now all a blur of Kings from the 12<sup>th</sup> century and even some from the 9<sup>th</sup> century.</p>

<p>Our guide, Khom is young, devoted, intense, a very detailed perfectionist and a fountain of knowledge, which he divulges in great detail.&nbsp; We started at Ankor Thom.&nbsp; The site is vast.&nbsp; Over the years various Kings had their own pet building project, which adds up to quite a conglomeration of buildings.&nbsp; There are Hindu, and predominantly Buddhist temples, mostly built in the 12<sup>th</sup> century.&nbsp; There is a 16 km moat around the lot, fed by natural springs and rain.</p>

<div class="article">
<p>We started at Ankor Thom, which has a central city area called Bayon.&nbsp; It was built by a very active chap called King Jayavarman VII.&nbsp; It alone, covers an area of 9 km<sup>2</sup>.&nbsp; The Bayon has lots of towers with Buddhas facing thee four directions of the compass.</p>

<p>One of the most well-known areas is Ta Prohm.&nbsp; Think "Lara Croft, Tomb Raider"; think "unrenovated".&nbsp; Huge tree roots snake around the ruins.</p>

<p>The French, German, Japanese and Czech governments all were helping with the renos, as was UNESCO.</p>

<p>We have a pass for visiting all these sights with our photo on the ticket.&nbsp; This is the "before" version of us.&nbsp; Hate to think what the "after" will be like.</p>

	</div>
<p>Collapsed into the shower after all of this, and resurrected to go to dinner at "Touich" restaurant, as recommended on TripAdvisor.&nbsp; They offered to pick us up, as the restaurant is in the back blocks.&nbsp; This turned out to be the best part.</p>

<p>A very friendly chap (as all Cambodians seem to be), arrived at our hotel in the oldest jeep on the planet.&nbsp; Maybe WWII!&nbsp; At least that was when the roadworthy was done.&nbsp; There were no walls, doors, roof etc., and we had to cling on like grim death.&nbsp; Suspension had not been invented when this baby was built.</p>

<p>Anyway, had the red snapper done on the barbie in a salt crust.&nbsp; Unfortunately overdone.&nbsp; Mike's ginger chicken was very good.&nbsp; The atmosphere and the staff were fantastic.</p>

<p>Then back to our 3 star hotel in the jeep, where we received some startled looks as we climbed out.</p>

<p>Trying to be brave about facing tomorrow, but think I might have hot nightmares!</p>

<p>Forgot to mention that tomorrow is Khmer New Year.&nbsp; Everyone is on holidays, and decorations abound!</p>

<p>Cheers, Maureen.</p>

<h3>Siem Reap</h3>

<p><strong>Happy Khmer New Year!</strong></p>

<p>The exiled Thai Prime Minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, is in town.&nbsp; Tomorrow, there is a big reception for him and there are goodness knows how many army and police in town.&nbsp; They are standing everywhere, beside their motor bikes, with big automatic weapons at the ready.&nbsp; Very welcoming.</p>

<p>The children here are on school holidays, which means that they are available all day to pester tourists to buy awful souvenirs.&nbsp; They are unbelievably clever.&nbsp; Every sales pitch in the book has been memorized.&nbsp; A little bunch of tiny children today, recited at a breathless pace, the numbers one to ten in at least 5 languages.</p>

<p>The local currency is used with reluctance.&nbsp; Instead, the greenback is the go everywhere.</p>

<p>Usually, on holidays, I halve my blood pressure tablets.&nbsp; No stress.&nbsp; Went to 1/4 today, and was much less faint.&nbsp; Maybe don't need them at all when not trying to operate under pressure.&nbsp; .&nbsp; Also, today we were more able to duck into the shadows, as we visited smaller temples.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I won't complain about a silly little one hour, air-conditioned step class at the gym ever again!</p>

<h2 id="dt20120414">Saturday 14 April</h2>
<h3>Siem Reap �&gt; fly to Hanoi</h3>
</div>

<div class="article">
<p>In the morning, we "did" more temples.&nbsp; This time, they were some distance away.&nbsp; Firstly, Banteay Samre and then Banteay Srey.</p>

<p>They were made of pink sandstone, and were remarkably well preserved, considering they dated back to 967.&nbsp; The carvings were very finely and intricately done.</p>

<p>It was very busy, as countless Thai people (well, 50,000 apparently), in fleets of buses were all around Siem Riep for the big meeting tonight with their exiled Prime Minister.&nbsp; Nearly all were wearing red shirts.&nbsp; Even more police and soldiers lined the streets, mostly under umbrellas, so their automatic rifles did not become prematurely hot!</p>

<p>The Thais continued to flood into town all day, and there was quite a traffic jam on the way to the airport this afternoon.</p>

<p>Di and Kay are magic!&nbsp; Met up with them this afternoon in Siem Reip, soon after their flight landed from Ho Chi Minh.&nbsp; With their equipment, I was finally able to fix my ear!&nbsp;  Yeehar!</p>

<p>It was great to see Kay and Di again, albeit briefly.&nbsp; Di's Mum, Pat, had been run into by a motor bike in Ho Chi Minh, and was sporting a large bandage on her leg.&nbsp; A bit worrying!</p>

<h3>Stepping Stones Cambodia</h3>

<p>We had arranged to meet a gentleman called Sok So, and we spent some time with him at our hotel, having read about him In the Courier Mail colour magazine.&nbsp; With the help of a couple of young Aussies, So has built a school in a village outside Siem Reap.&nbsp; The idea is that the children are taught English, so that their job prospects considerably improve.&nbsp; Some go to the Government school as well, but spend at least one hour a day going to his First Steps School.&nbsp; Eighty per cent of people in Siem Riep (population 1 million), work in some capacity connected with the tourist industry.</p>

<p>In Cambodia, there are two shifts of school each day, so children attend either morning or afternoon.&nbsp; Mostly, they spend the other half of the day working - on the farm or selling produce or souvenirs.&nbsp; Many drop out before finishing Primary School.</p>

<p>Aussies have installed solar power at the school.&nbsp; This is a big advance, as most villages have no electricity.&nbsp; They have 19 laptops, to teach computer skills, and English.&nbsp; A number have been donated by BBC in Brisbane, and Grace College at Redcliffe has also been a big financial support.</p>

<p>They have installed water filtration and, in the future, hope to establish a medical clinic and an organic farm.</p>

<p>The school�s focus is English teaching and it is not aligned with any religious group.&nbsp; We were invited to come and see the school but the children are on a 2 week break for New Year holidays.</p>

<p>Read more about the inspirational Sok So and his project at <a href="http://steppingstonescambodia.org/">Stepping Stones Cambodia</a>.

<p>Hanoi</p>

<p>Yet again, Vietnam Airlines was right on schedule.&nbsp; We were met in Hanoi by a very comical chap, called Quin, and have settled into the Maison d'Hanoi Hanova.&nbsp; Glad we paid for an upgraded room with a window.&nbsp; Very nice.</p>

<p>Cheers, Maureen.</p>

<h3>Hanoi</h3>
</div>

<div class="article">
<p>Our hotel, in the Old French Quarter, is smallish.&nbsp; Maybe 50 rooms.&nbsp; Almost all seem to be Aussies.&nbsp; So you can imagine, that we were rather surprised to be given celebrity status by the locals touring the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum.&nbsp; Especially Mike.&nbsp; Again!!&nbsp; This phenomenon has been previously seen in Shanghai, Barcelona and even Norway!</p>

<p>A huge group from country Vietnam had never really seen "Westerners", and mobbed us like we were rock stars.&nbsp; We complained to our guide that Aussie's are actually "Southerners", not "Westerners", but apparently we all look alike.&nbsp; EVERYONE, wanted a photo with us.&nbsp; Mike is weird and pale and they had not seen anyone like him.&nbsp; Don't these people have TV.&nbsp; Or Google?&nbsp; Maybe not.</p>

<p>We arrived early to see Ho Chi Minh, and the queues were already enormous.&nbsp; Will have to send the Vietnamese some suggestions for fun family Sundays.&nbsp; They are in dire need.</p>

<p>Anyway, eventually we filed past the fellow.&nbsp; He looked pretty good for someone who had been dead since 1969.&nbsp; The Mausoleum is severe, austere, and heavily policed.&nbsp; A mini Mao Tse Tung/ Tiananmen Square affair.&nbsp; Same architecture.&nbsp; Powerful.</p>

<p>Apparently, Ho wanted to be cremated and tossed in a simple grave.&nbsp; Didn't quite get his last wish on that one.</p>

<p>HCM's house was nice, small and simple, and is well maintained.&nbsp; The Presidential Palace was suitably impressive, and I'm sure Julia G.&nbsp; and even Obama, would feel at home when visiting Hanoi.</p>

<p>The French exploited Vietnam, and especially Hanoi, for 100 years.&nbsp; In return, the French left architecture, bakeries and Catholicism.&nbsp; All are evident in modern Hanoi.&nbsp; Not sure if this was a good deal.</p>

<p>We saw the small One Pillar Pagoda, dating from the 11th century.&nbsp; Most Vietnamese are Atheists, apparently.&nbsp; However, there seem to be plenty of practicing Buddhists every time we are anywhere near a Pagoda.</p>

<p>Quin took us to an embroidery factory, staffed by the disabled.&nbsp; Many have deformities subsequent to Agent Orange.&nbsp; Lovely work.&nbsp; Even better and cheaper than the able-bodied embroidery place in Hoi An.</p>

<p>We spent quite a while at the Museum of Ethnology.&nbsp; This place had indoor and outdoor exhibits depicting how people in Vietnam's ethnic minorities dress, live, eat etc.&nbsp; We decided not to see the Hoa Lo prison, also known as the "Hanoi Hilton".&nbsp; We are all atrocitied out.</p>

<p>The Temple of Literature, Vietnam's first University, built in the 11th Century, was an interesting stop.&nbsp; Some of it was reconstructed after being bombed by those jolly Americans.</p>

<p>The sympathy vote for the day goes to the two Cyclo drivers, who spent an hour peddling us around the Old Quarter of Hanoi.&nbsp; It was a great way to see everything, with buses, motorbikes and cars, weaving their way around us.</p>

<p>Then on to a Water Puppet Show.&nbsp; Very well done indeed.&nbsp; The place was quite packed.&nbsp; Luckily, we had spare seats beside us.&nbsp; There was simply not enough length for us to fit our knees in the seats.&nbsp; Sideways was the only option!</p>

<p>We did a drive past the Opera House, built in 1911.&nbsp; HCM had travelled to Paris, and quite liked the Opera.</p>

<p>Then, we left our guide, and walked around the lake, over the famous red bridge, and up to a 5th floor cafe, to see the view, and have a drink.&nbsp; It was a short walk back to the hotel.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we are off to Halong Bay, spending 2 nights on a Junk.&nbsp; As they say...&nbsp; Someone�s gotta do it!</p>

<p>Love, Maureen</p>

<h3>Hanoi -&gt; drive to Ha Long Bay</h3>
</div>

<div class="article">
<p>Ended up at a place called "The Hanoi Social Club" for dinner last night.&nbsp; It was in a back street of the Hanoi Old French Quarter.&nbsp; Very Bohemian.&nbsp; Simple, nice and cheap.&nbsp; The building was an old French terrace house, with shuttered doors leading on to little balconies on several floors.&nbsp; Cute.</p>

<p>Early this morning we were transferred by private car to Halong Bay.&nbsp; In Australia, the drive would be considered terrifying.&nbsp; Here, it was skilful driving.&nbsp; Weaving over double lines, and passing cars with a few millimetres to spare etc.&nbsp; We had a few light showers on the way.&nbsp; As we approached Halong Bay, the weather cleared.</p>

<p>The junk is the Victory Star.&nbsp; Very comfortable.&nbsp; There are a few dozen on board, and quite a mix of nationalities.&nbsp; The French predominate.&nbsp; Only 10 of us are doing the 2 night cruise.</p>

<p>We admired the dramatic limestone cliffs rising near vertically from a deep green sea.&nbsp; With four to a rowing boat, we toured a waterborne fishing village.&nbsp; The ladies who rowed our boats certainly don't need gym memberships.</p>

<p>Then, we had time for swimming and kayaking.&nbsp; Mike and I are hopeless at the latter, and the water temperature was 21C.&nbsp; Not to mention the fact that it looked a little polluted with bonus large jellyfish.&nbsp; So we chatted on the deck to like-minded passengers instead.</p>

<p>Meals are marathon affairs.&nbsp; 6 courses for both lunch and dinner.&nbsp; Very nice, but there is only so much a person can enjoy.</p>

<p>We had a cooking lesson before dinner.&nbsp; Simple and tasty stuff.</p>

<p>Looking forward to more Halong Bay tomorrow.</p>

<p>Love, Maureen</p>

<h3>Halong Bay Cruise</h3>
</div>

<div class="article">
<p>On the boat, we don't have to worry about money.&nbsp; Just charge it and pay at the end.&nbsp; A relief!</p>

<p>While Cambodians almost never used their official currency, the Real, Vietnam is more fond of the Dong than the Dollar.&nbsp; But...&nbsp; It is crazy.&nbsp; Typical was the scenario on checking out of the hotel in Hanoi.<br />
Me: "<em>We drank one Diet Coke from the mini-bar.</em>"<br />
Front Desk Receptionist: "<em>That will be 2 dollar.</em>" &nbsp; So, I give her USD2.<br />
Front Desk Rec.: "<em>We don't take dollar.</em>"<br />
Me: "<em>But you just said it was $2!</em>"<br />
FDR: "<em>But it is 48,000 dong.</em>"&nbsp; (A grossly inflated exchange rate!) &nbsp; I give her 50,000 dong.<br />
FDR: "<em>We do not have change.</em>" &nbsp; And she looks at *ME* like *I* am crazy!</p>

<p>So, as I said, it is a relief not to have this type of conversation all day.</p>

<p>Today, all 10 of us on the 2 night cruise, transferred to a smaller boat for day tripping.&nbsp; It was lovely to be offered cold drinks soon after boarding.&nbsp; Ten minutes later, they came with the bill.&nbsp; Would have been nice to be told we were paying when drinks were offered!</p>

<p>We went cruising around, and the day was cloudy, but only 27C.&nbsp; Arrived at Hang Sun Sot caves.&nbsp; Lots of steps, but in the shade.&nbsp; Not like Cambodia.&nbsp; We had prepared by attending the early morning Tai Chi class on the boat, so, as you can imagine, we took to it all like mountain goats.</p>

<p>Rather nice, but not as good as Jenolan, or the Texas Caves which Bjelke-Petersen dynamited when he chose the caves for the site of the Glen Lyon Dam.&nbsp; At least we saw the Texas Caves pre shameful environmental vandalism.</p>

<p>Then went to a beach which looked like sand had been artificially added.&nbsp; Some went swimming.&nbsp; The water was 21C and I didn't like the turbidity enhanced by stryofoam and other litter.&nbsp; Very glad that we have done the limestone Palawan islands in the Philippines.&nbsp; Similar geography, but crystal clear water, and great coral and marine life to boot.&nbsp; Anyway, good reading time was had!</p>

<p>On to a bay, with more caves, reached by kayak.&nbsp; Mike was not at all keen, given his disastrous kayaking in the Philippines, so we relaxed on the boat.&nbsp; I am into my sixth novel - unprecedented on a holiday.&nbsp; iPads are brilliant!</p>

<p>The normal six course lunch was served!&nbsp; Nice seafood.&nbsp; Luckily, that came first!</p>

<p>Then, more cruising around and back to the main ship.</p>

<p>Nice day!</p>

<p>Cheers, Maureen.</p>

<h3>Halong Bay �&gt; drive to Hanoi</h3>
</div>

<div class="article">
<p>Last day!</p>

<p>Left the Victory Star ship today.&nbsp; Was a bit cranky that the boat cancelled the tour on our itinerary this morning, and just told us we had to spend the time on the boat.&nbsp; Not what we paid for.&nbsp; Another man from the US was not happy either.&nbsp; The French manager on the boat didn't care less.&nbsp; Told him our travel agent and internet publicity would follow up.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the ship provided great staff, fantastic food, a lovely room, fairly good weather (just cloudy, no rain) and lovely scenery.&nbsp; The pollution was, of course, sad.&nbsp; I would recommend the one night cruise, because it appears you don't do a lot more on the 2 night cruise.</p>

<p>We are going to La Badiane restaurant for a final (French) meal, tonight in Hanoi.&nbsp; Leave early for the airport tomorrow, and have over 7 1/2 hours in Kuala Lumpur.&nbsp; Then home on Friday morning to a mountain of paper work.&nbsp; All good things must end!</p>

<p>Have had a fabulous time, and feel I have really "done" Vietnam and Cambodia thoroughly.&nbsp; Have to thank our travel agent, Mr Do Ha, at Private Asia Tours, for really looking after us.</p>

<p>The best thing was the people.&nbsp; Polite, hardworking, conscientious, and positive.&nbsp; Life is not easy for people here, but seems less complicated.&nbsp; We are so much more privileged in Australia, yet we worry so much.&nbsp; Maybe our expectations are just too high for our own good!</p>

<p>Cheers, Maureen.</p>
