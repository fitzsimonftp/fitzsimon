Bath was warmer and was magical. I could spend a week there. The town is just georgeous. Local town planning laws insist that the same yellow stone be used everywhere.<BR>

The 2000 year old Roman baths were obviously stunning in their day and absolutely huge, with lots of pools. What is most amazing is that they are still running at the same pressure. In Rotorua, the pressure of the thermal pools has decreased dramatically over the years, but Bath hasn't suffered over 2000 years of civilization.<BR>

<TD WIDTH="55%" VALIGN="TOP">
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>The day was almost hot, and no clouds at all. Everyone says it usually rains for Wimbledon. The Tower Bridge looked magnificent and so did the new Greater London City Hall, which some people don't like. They sold the old one to the Japanese to turn into a hotel. To make matters worse, the Japanese apparently haven't even paid for it yet. The new one was really expensive, and soon to be opened by the Queen. The Mayor is in deep trouble at the moment for bashing up people at a party. (Makes Jimmy Sorley look good!)<BR>

The Tower of London was fascinating. Again, you could spend all day and more there. The crown jewels were certainly spectacular too. (They are in the building below, where there were no crowds, even on a perfect day. They must all be at Wimbledon.) Don't you like the 6 foot 9 inch suit of armour and the little kid's matching suit.<BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;Got dressed up. We were the best-dressed couple on the Tube going to the theatre. Great show, excellent production. Really appreciated the English "sur-titles" projected above the stage. The Royal Opera House is very impressive architecturally but cannot handle the ingress and egress of people at interval as easily as our own Performing Arts Centre. Maureen reports however that the Ladies were better equipped. Most others were dressed up however Maureen saw two real bohemians dressed in Hawaiian shirts and thongs. The trip home on the Tube was quite crowded. All the West-End theatres emptied at once.</FONT></TD>

He looked at Mike's braces and thought we were toffs. I think I should come back to Harrods with Desley Sayers - we could really do some damage together.

The Victoria and Albert Museum was spellbinding. We both decided that we could spend a week there. How could Glennys H. and Peter Mills says there wasn't enough to do in London in 8 days.? In the pictures you can see the new Chandalier (which was clever, but not very nice), a 1500s Indian bracelet given as a gift by Queen Elizabeth I to a loyal servant (now how did that end up in England?), and a 1410 Natural History dissertation.</P>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>Saw the Millennium Dome. It cost �750 million, and ended up closing as a fizzer costing �100,000 a week just to keep it shut. In the end, they gave it away and it might open as a sports stadium.  You can see a large circular hole in the roof. They forgot to allow for gas exhaust emissions from the underlying motorway! Nearby is a sculpture called the Millennium Man constructed from lots of bits of metal, looking a little like a man. Unfortunately, while the artist was direction construction, about 1/3 of the pieces fell into the Thames, so it takes a bit of imagination to see the man now.</P>
<P>More impressive is the Thames Flood Barrier.  Scotland has arranged that the England end of Britain tips into the sea at 1-2 feet every hundred years while Scotland rises.  This would often flood a lot of London, where the Thames has 20 foot tides. The barrier has stopped London flooding dozens of times in the last 20 years. <BR>

Greenwich was beautiful.  Eighteen degrees max (again), but fine weather. Apparently, they will declare a drought in a few days, because it has been fine for a week. Lots of Lord Nelson stuff at the Maritime Museum,. <BR>

They have good sundials too, which can be used for a couple of days a year.  In the background you can see Englishmen enjoying a sunny Saturday afternoon mucking about in boats.<BR>

We got to stand on either side of the 0 degree line of longitude, with a foot in each hemisphere. When we got back to Westminster, Big Ben was glittering in the sunlight.  It had better be raining when we return to London in three weeks or we'll never believe our own stories about England's weather. <BR>

This evening we saw the huge crowd gathering in Hyde Park (seen from our hotel room), ready for the "Picnic in the Park" charity concert.</P>
<P>Tomorrow morning we leave for Brussels. Won't have as much time for e-mails and the web site, and I'm sure you will all be relieved to hear that!</FONT> </TD>
