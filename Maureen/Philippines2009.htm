<h1>Maureen�s Philippines Adventure 2009</h1>

<h2>Thursday 22nd October</h2>
<p>
Well,have made it as far as Manila.  another museum piece plane,but we are used to that one. <br />
Took $600 each to last the 12 days, as ATMs are not available where we are heading. This is 44,000 pesos. You are allowed to bring in only 10,000. Also,there are only 3 professional groups targetted by customs on entry. Yep, medicos might have been in contact with ....you guessed it swine flu! <br />
So was a bit nervous on the plane,lest I be penniless and quarantined. <br />
Turned out we could find not a soul serving the "stuff to declare" queue. The bloke on the nothing to declare queue said in a loud voice "you go to the bank to get pesos" and winked. So much for fessing up. We are just so damn serious about honest answers on customs forms in Australia,USA etc., <br />
It got more serious at the hotel. Sniffer dogs,scanners,mirrors under cars, the boot inspected in the taxi 100 metres from the front door! Felt like the good old middle east all over again. <br />
Tomorrow,kick off at 6am ,heading into a typhoon and landslides. A girl just has to have fun. <br />
love,Maureen

Dear Friends,<br />
<br />
It turns out that our guide has a miracle function installed on his rosary beads. Have just done the over 10 hour drive from Manila to Banaue with barely a spot of rain, let alone a typhoon... Yet.<br />
Our guide, Manny is a good Catholic, and so has 6 sons (and a daughter). We figure we are only barely half good, with 3 sons. His son, Christian, aged 28, is also looking after us. There are only the two of us on the tour. We look THAT dodgy. We need one guide each.<br />
The road to Banaue is through mountains and is mostly concrete, so bumpy. The Lake Como road was way , way worst. More traffic, narrower, and crazy drivers. The Banaue road is very slow due to people using the road to dry their rice, which narrows it for many, many kms, to only one lane. Add to this the many Jeepneys, 50cc motorbikes with side cars with half a dozen passengers. Or huge loads piled high. The villages are almost continuous, and lots of tiny children run perilously close to traffic without any obvious supervision. Add to all this ducks, dogs, goats, and carts pulled by water buffalo.<br />
Lunch was cheap and tasty. The rice had little black things in it. Probably bits of car tyre left over from drying the rice on the road. (Only kidding!)<br />
Gave Mike half the money, breaking my rule about not letting him have more than five dollars. On arriving in Banaue, he announced losing HALF HIS LOOT. Found it later. He is now banned from carrying more than two dollars. <br />
On arriving at our hotel, there was a big sign outside "Welcome MS Maurreen Fitzsimon and Co." Nice to be famous. Mike is not so keen on being a Co. But it is a big improvement on what  I called him when he misplaced the money. <br />
Love Maureen<br />

<p>
Well..we're alive. Looks like we could have done our last ever big trek in one day. Can't imagine being able to survive a day like that again!<br />
At least we made it without needing CPR. The guide looked dubious. No wonder.<br />
<br />
We had bardly started the downhill first section, when I tripped over a tree root and went flying.Remembered to not put out my arms to save myself (to avoid fractured arms). Sort of rolled and took the fall on my natural insulation.Nora, our local guide, must have really been worried about the pair of duds she was landed with. The mountains are very steep, stony, muddy, and have lots of loose small rocks to cause spills. Of course, in my younger days, it would have been a doddle. <br />
Felt very dehydrated, and had a drink at Rita's, which sits just above the village of Batad. It was very hot as we headed out to the rice terraces. Sun shing. No typhoon. Coming back to Rita's,later,was steep and I felt ill and faint and my heart was racing. Bitten off more than I could chew?Dehydrated and cursing my blood pressure tablets, which are designed for the high stress environment of work, not holidays. Really struggled back to Rita's, and very nervous about the next few hours, which were all uphill. Palpitations still going strong. Had visions of having to ask Rita's for somewhere to sleep, or being carried out on a stretcher by poor littlePhillipino men. Drank heaps of Gatorade (4 bottles), at huge prices for the Phillipines, plus water.After a while, the treking uphill seemed easier, and the palpitations stopped, and we were back to normal. ie Mike was the one struggling.<br />
Was it worth it?Absolutely. The Ifugo Rice Terraces are considered by some to be the Eighth Wonder of the World. They were engineered 2000 years ago. People work so hard on these precipitious slopes, harvesting not only rice, but sweet potatoes, bananas, ratan, and other fruits. <br />
The Terraces near Banaue are mud walled, and those at Batad (our trek today), are stone walled. The stones were dragged huge distances from the river, to form the walls of the terraces. <br />
We eventually made it to a bar, where a beer and a sprite cost $2. See, told you it was worth it. You only live once!<br />
Love Maureen<br />

<p>
Surviving. Off to caves and other sights today. Soles of both our shoes have come off after the tough trek yesterday. <br />
<img src="Images/philippines/25102009.jpeg" />
</p>

<p>Have done a major revision of anatomy. Can now be absolutely certain of the position of each and every muscle and joint in the human body! They all hurt like crazy!</p>
<p>The hiking was not so bad. But the Jeppney riding over very rough roads, still under construction since !976, was the best isometric exercise we have ever had. For hours and hours. What! You say, You two have done years of 4 wheel driving. the difference is that we have never done it in a vehicle without any suspension, sitting on a plank, and hanging on for grim death the whole way. </p>
<p>The driver was fantastic, and the day just marvellous. The road was hand made out of concrete. So there were little patches of concrete, then rough and wet dirt, rocky sections, then concrete etc., Lots and lots of work men and women really toiling and looking overwhelmed and sad. They work long days, for little pay, away from their families, living in rough tents. And Aussies whinge!</p>
<p>We saw lots of landslides, a hazard of living in the mountains. Luckily, none hit us. Did I mention the clear blue skies - perfect weather. So much for typhoons.</p>
<p>We should enter into the Olympics a sport where you have to jump on a rapidly moving Jeepney, and then hang on for many kilometres. Except that it wouldn' t be fair - the Phillipinoes would win all the gold medals. </p>
<p>The scenery today was picture postcard perfect. Babbling brooks, raging rivers, waterfalls, little bridges, amazing patterns in the rice fields. Of course, there were interminable rice terraces. Many old people sat on their haunches for hours. What quads! What hamstrings!We asked how old one agile (but blind) old lady was? 100 years old! It looked like her blindness was due to cataracts . Easily treated in Australia. Should be easily treated in the Phillipines. But not an option for her. As our guide said "If you work very hard, there is no need to starve". But if you can't....</p>
<p>The Phillipinos are delightful. They don't push you to buy things, and they are so polite. So sad to see a sticker on the back of our jeepney asking people to report those involved in paedophilia. The children are so beautiful and have such freedom. How dare these people exploit them!</p>
<p>We met a nun who showed us around a museum that Belgian nuns had established in Bontoc. It seems that these missionaries celebrated the local culture and Christianity enhanced it, rather than squashing it. Nice to see. She had a collection of notes (money), from around the world. Educational for the children. We were able to donate Aussie dollars, of various denominations, Egyptian pounds, and Euros. Amazing what you find at the bottom of a travel wallet! She even sweet talked us out of Phillipino pesos. We are always suckers for nuns. We toured her herb garden, met her pig, and admired her museum. The school had the alphabet on the wall outside the classrooms. There we found "K" was for kangaroo. </p>
<p>Came back to a nice beer with our wonderful guide, Manny, and his son, Christain.Solved all the world's problems, as you do, over a beer.Dreadful noise in the hotel, - a convention of pastors - the Hallelulia,shouting, happy clappy American type. Never mind, they usually tgo to bed early and do not normally have drunkenrages, so it should quieten down soon. Of course, the scary thing is, that this means the Micks are under threat!</p>

<p>
As you all know, a massive typhoon was predicted to hit the northern Phillipines as we arrived. Most travellers ended up cancelling and so Banaue is dead quiet as far as tourists are concerned. They hgave already had a severe decline in tourism since the world wide recession. We have been treated like royalty.<br />
Another luxury has been the loos. So far, all very clean and Western. Mind, you, Manny and Christain have been very selective in their choices.<br />
Heading back on the long drive to Manila, we again had lovely weather. Enjoyed the beautiful scenery, and the cacophony of motorbikes with side cars, wildly colourful jeepneys and people.<br />
Arrived to the shocking pollution of Manila, and could hardly breathe. <br />
Love to all,<br />

Dear Friends,<br />
For some reason I cannot send Emails via my phone, so am finally back in Manila, with one big Email to send. Tomorrow we fly to the Palawan islands and I doubt very much if we will even have phone access. There is a typhoon heading for the Phillipines again, but should not hit for at least 72 hours, and should hit the east coast, and we will be in Miniloc Island, on the Palawan islands, in the west.<br />
Manila's pollution is probably the worst I have seen in the world. Sure beats Beijing, and even Bangkok. Can hardly breathe, and am shooting up on the asthma puffers, with only some effect. We are going to have a chilled out day today, doing some shopping, and walking up to the old Spanish area of Intramuros. (If we are still breathing). Our hotel, the Diamond, is very nice, and I am planning to really enjoy it. We upgraded to a package for $35 each per day which includes breakfast, dinner, and all the drinks you like from 5.30pm to 8pm. The food is amazing. <br />
We sadly said goodbye to Manny and Christian yesterday. What lovely people. It was a huge drive back to Manila. 11 hours. And the traffic in Manila is ghastly. Manny drove Jeepneys for 5 years, and then was a limosine driver for a big hotel, so he is used to it. <br />
Tomorrow we leave on a 19 seater plane which lands on a grass strip, and then we take a boat to the island. Lots of swimming and snorkelling will follow!<br />
Hopefully, Rob will send you all a message that my travel diary so far is on my web page (courtesy of Peter).<br />
Hope everyone is well,<br />
Maureen. <br />

Little plane to El Nido. Glorious flight. We were weighed and so was all our luggage. Max 10 kg allowed in total. They inspected every single item we packed,took our temp etc., I expect that when we return,they will tell us we ate like pigs and are a stone heavier. Love Maureen
</p>
<p>
Beautiful afternoon. We were the only couple who needed someone to help kayak,so they took us separately after we capsized. Snorkelled. Very nice,but barrier reef better. Mike not as good as Jill Goan at snorkelling. Love Maureen
</p>
<h2>Thursday 29th October</h2>
<p>
Brilliant weather. Fantastic day. Travelled to magic tropical beaches,explored caves,sat onthe balcony and watched the fish swim. Met lovely people from all over the world. Mostly Phillipinos who now live in Canada,the USA etc., Staff here treat everyone like Royalty. Food is way too good. Love Maureen
</p>
<p>Island hopping tour . Swam at Vigan (Snake island). Sandbar lools like a snake. Climbed to lookout. Met lovely fun people. We are still the oldest. Next toured limestone caves,and lunch on =Pangulasian. paradise. Only inhabited islands are Miniloc and Lagen. The rest have day fascilities. Perfect weather 30C every day. Sunny. Love Maureen</p>
<h2>Friday 30th October</h2>
<p> Went on romantic moonlight cruise to Lagen. Only the two of us under a beautiful sky (and 4 crew members,who jumped up if we so much as breathed differently!) Lagen is a sister resort in Bacuit Bay. Spent the day on Entalula island. Tropical fish++,coral,crystal clear water,white sand. Fun on catamaran. Lovely bar-b-que. Someone.s gotta do it! Love Maureen</p>

<h2>Saturday 31st October</h2>
<p>Apparently, typhoon headed for Manila. All flights cancelled. We are marooned on a tropical island. Only 3 Banquets a day for sustenence. Slightly cloudy here. Snorkelled until exhausted. Layer after layer of sunblock applied and still fried. Will repeat experience today. About 5 staff members for each guest here! Love to all, Maureen</p>
<p>where in the world do you find a resort where you are charged $5 for 2 large cappucinos and a pot of tea? In Italy,you would not even get to sit on a chair for that. Have taught Mike snorkelling and kayaking. Did 3 hours of it, and saw giant clams,starfish,and even Nemo and his family. All in the water just in front of our room! Love Maureen </p>
<p>last night went to sister resort,Lagen,for dinner. Romantc,moon-lit night.one hour cruise.just the two of us -and 4 crew on the boat. Tonight big Halloween party. Some poor people suffering by spending another night here in Paradise,because all flights cancelled. No rain here,but a bit cloudy. </p>
<h2>Sunday 1st November</h2>
<p>Halloween party last night. Staff and some guests dressed up very scarily. All good fun. Nice singer,and one of the guests sang as well and had the voice of an angel. Today, more snorkelling. Have many bruises,but a huge one on my arm. Snorkelled into a boat! Love to all Maureen </p>
<p>Photos show typical view in Bacuit with one of the many white sandy beaches. Also,me,the super snorkeller,while fish bite my legs!
A pack of monkeys visited today,running all over the trees and rooves. Quite shy. Saw a huge box jellyfish. Nasty bugger. About 3m from us. Decided to swim fast in the other direction. Saved Mike's life...again.Love Maureen.</p>

<h3>Monday 2nd November</h3>
<p><img src="Images/philippines/02112009-2.jpeg" /><br />Made some hats for the Melbourne cup</p>
<p>Heartbreaking to leave today. Going for one last snorkel. Mike stll recovering from 4 cocktails last night. Some people have no stamina. Will miss cocktails ($2.50 each). Have had amazing weather. 5 mins rain all holiday. Staff will sing us farewell at 11.30am. Leave Manila 6.35pm and arrive Brisbane 3.55am (good on you Robbie!). Love Maureen</p>
<img src="Images/philippines/02112009.jpeg" />
<p>Am in a paying lounge at Manila Airport. $15 for computer access, papers, lots of food and drink. Had one pass only to the Qantas club lounge and this saves a fight. 
Have had a fabulous time. Said goodbye to Nemo and all of his family, as well as my favourite clams and starfish. The 1metre Jackfish will no doubt miss dodging me as I snorkel by. And will I miss the coral!!
 Absolutely brilliant weather still.  So enjoyed the trip back to El Nido on the boat, eyeing off all the white sandy beaches, fringed by palm trees, on all the bay islands. What a place!
Sat behind the captain and co pilot on the way back to Manila. No laptops in sight, although I did see the Captain close his eyes for 30 seconds at one point. Interesting to be able to read all the instruments as you go along. Took way too many photos of beautiful islands, countryside and volcanoes. Yes, the Phillipines has it all! 
We have found the people to be about the best in the world. So happy, friendly, and not on your case to buy their stuff all the time. Everything is so cheap. Our tips have probably been way over the top, but who cares? They deserve it.
Have just texted Rob that our flight is delayed and he is to pick us up at 5am. What day, he says?? Er, like tomorrow... <br />
Love to all,<br />
Maureen Fitzsimon<br /> </p>
