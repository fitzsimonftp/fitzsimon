For lunch we went out across the main lagoon to the island of <B>Burano</B> where the houses are not constrained by 400-year-old building codes. They are much more colourful. It was a fabulous lunch which lasted till about 4pm. We rolled back to the boat. Some of us were harder to roll than others.<BR>

<B>Santa Maria Di Angeles</B> This church has a little chapel inside it, where St Francis of Assisi prayed, and where he also died. They built the Basilica around the little old chapel. Like many European churches, there was a basement, with the tombs of the clergy and prominent citizens, and then the current church above. Given St Francis' philosophy on life, I don't think he would have approved of the building of such an elaborate church!<BR>

Up on the hill is the town, with St Francis' Basilica. We had a tour through the basilica by one of the Franciscan priests (from the USA). He gave us great insights into the 13<SUP>th</SUP> and 14<SUP>th</SUP> century frescoes, done by painters such as Giotto. They were still repairing the damage to the church from the 1997 Earthquake. This was one of the few churches we visited which felt religious. Most of the others felt like art museums. The shops and cobbled streets were absolutely delightful, and we all wished we had another day to enjoy Assisi.<BR>

<B>Naples</B> was pretty horrible. Garbage everywhere, and suffocating smog. Apparently, the traffic lights are just for decoration. They just go straight through red lights. It was a near death experience crossing the road. We took the boat to the <B>Isle of Capri</B>, which was really beautiful. The water was crystal clear, and the buildings charming. The heat was pretty terrible, but it was cooler up the mountain, at Anacapri. We had lunch in a restaurant at Anacapri, with a great view, after a hair-raising trip in a bus to the top. Here's another bus coming the other way. The drivers seem to nonchalantly glide past each other with millimetres to spare. Unfortunately, the tides were not right to see the Blue Grotto.<BR>

The chairlift to the very top was like flying. I kept worrying that my sandals (with no back strap) were going to fall off and roll a thousand feet below. Still, the view was worth any number of sandals. Above is the view looking down the southern side of the mountain at the top of Capri, straight down into the water. Below left is the view towards Sorrento.<BR>

<B>Rome</B> continued the heat wave, but it did improve at night. The first night, our group had a great dinner in the courtyard of a restaurant, and really got into the party mode. Afterwards, we went to the Trevi fountain at night and threw 3 coins into it.<BR>

<B>Sistine Chapel</B>. The ceiling was breathtaking. It took Michaelangelo 22 years to paint it. More recently, the Japanese have cleaned it up, and it looks good as new. It took them 23 years to achieve the clean-up, as the work was so delicate. In return, they get souvenir rights. All of the magnificent cathedrals etc., that we saw in Europe cost a fortune to maintain, so have had to become very commercial! Below is the famous "God creating Man" scene.<BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>This afternoon we received the news that Mike's Dad had passed away. When we were in Vienna, it was thought he was coming home from hospital in a few days. On the day we headed to Rome, we were told he would not make it through the night. We desperately tried to get on the next flight out, but because it was the beginning of the Italian summer school holidays, we had to wait 48 hours for the next vacancy. Mike would not have made it, even if he would have been able to get on the plane, as soon as we heard the situation. He arrived in Brisbane, the day before the funeral, and was able to deliver the eulogy. Maureen continued with the tour group for the last week of the tour without him.<BR>
On the day he left Rome, (Sunday), Mike attended Mass at St Peter's and could understand every word, as it was in Latin, just like when we were kids. </FONT></TD>
